Licensing Agreement 295x Contents8322 Prelims (i-xvi)  25/2/02  3:04 pm  Page xThis book provides a ‘hardware-free’ introduction to embedded software for
people who:
GAlready know how to write software for ‘desktop’ computer systems."
Book 1,"GAre familiar with a C-based language (Java, C++ or C)."
Book 1,GWant to learn how C is used in practical embedded systems.
Book 1,"The remainder of this preface attempts to answer some questions which prospec-
tive readers may have about the contents."
Book 1,I What is an embedded system?
Book 1,"As far as this book is concerned:
This type of embedded system is all around us."
Book 1,"Use of embedded processors in pas-
senger cars, mobile phones, medical equipment, aerospace systems and defencesystems is widespread, and even everyday domestic appliances such as dishwash-ers, televisions, washing machines and video recorders now include at least onesuch device."
Book 1,II What type of processor is discussed?
Book 1,This book focuses on the embedded systems based on the 8051 family of microcon-trollers.
Book 1,Prices for 8051 devices start at less than $1.00 (US).
Book 1,"At this price, you get aperformance of around 1 million instructions per second, and 256 bytes (not
megabytes!) of on-chip RAM."
Book 1,"The 8051’s profile (price, performance, availablememory) matches the needs of many embedded systems very well."
Book 1,"As a result, thePreface
An embedded system is an application that contains at least one programmablecomputer (typically in the form of a microcontroller, a microprocessor or digitalsignal processor chip) and which is used by individuals who are, in the main,unaware that the system is computer-based.8322 Prelims (i-xvi)  25/2/02  3:04 pm  Page xixii Preface
8051 architecture – originally developed by Intel – is now implemented in more than
400 chips; these are produced by a diverse range of companies including Philips,Infineon, Atmel and Dallas."
Book 1,"Sales of this vast family are estimated to have the largestshare (around 60%) of the microcontroller market as a whole, and to make up morethan 50% of the 8-bit microcontroller market."
Book 1,"Versions of the 8051 are currently usedin a long list of embedded products, from automotive systems to children’s toys."
Book 1,"The low cost, huge range, easy availability and widespread use of the 8051
family makes it an excellent platform for developing embedded systems: thesesame factors also make it an ideal platform for learning about embedded systems."
Book 1,"Whether you will subsequently use 8-, 16- or 32-bit embedded processors, learningto work within the performance and memory limits of devices such as the 8051 isa crucial requirement in the cost-conscious embedded market."
Book 1,You simply cannotacquire these skills by developing code for a Pentium (or similar) processor.
Book 1,III Which operating system is used?
Book 1,"The 256 bytes of memory in the 8051 are – of course – insufficient to support any ver-sion of Windows, Linux or similar desktop operating systems."
Book 1,"Instead, we will describehow to create your own simple ‘embedded operating system’ (see Chapter 7)."
Book 1,"This ‘do-it-yourself’ approach is typical in small embedded applications, where the memoryrequirements and expense of a desktop operating system (like Windows or Linux) or ofa so-called ‘real-time operating system’ simply cannot be justified."
Book 1,"However, theapproach is also in widespread use in large embedded systems (for example, aerospaceapplications or X-by-wire systems in the automotive industry), where conventionaloperating systems are generally considered to be too unpredictable."
Book 1,"Learning to work on a ‘naked’ processor and create your own operating system are
key requirements for software developers wishing to work with embedded systems."
Book 1,IV What type of system is discussed?
Book 1,This book presents a number of examples adapted from working embedded sys-tems.
Book 1,"These include:
GA remotely-controlled robot."
Book 1,GA traffic-light sequencer.
Book 1,GA system for monitoring liquid flow rates.
Book 1,"GA controller for a domestic washing machine.8322 Prelims (i-xvi)  25/2/02  3:04 pm  Page xiixiii Preface
GAn animatronic dinosaur."
Book 1,GA general-purpose data acquisition system.
Book 1,"These and other examples are used to illustrate key software architectures that are
in widespread use in embedded designs; the examples may be adapted andextended to match the needs of your own applications."
Book 1,"The book concludes with a final case study: this brings together all of the fea-
tures discussed in earlier chapters in order to create an intruder alarm system."
Book 1,"Thiscase study includes the following key components:
GA suitable embedded operating system."
Book 1,GA multi-state system framework.
Book 1,GSoftware to process the inputs from door and window sensors.
Book 1,GA simple ‘keypad’ library to process passwords entered by the user.
Book 1,GSoftware to control external port pins (to activate the external bell).
Book 1,GAn ‘RS-232’ library to assist with debugging.
Book 1,V Do I need a degree in electronics in order to use this book?
Book 1,"Please consider the following statement: 
This is a concern which is commonly expressed by desktop programmers who – if
they ever learned anything about electronics at school, college or university –have probably forgotten it."
Book 1,"If you don’t know the difference between a MOSFET and a BJT, or even the dif-
ference between a resistor and a capacitor, please relax."
Book 1,"You don’t need to have
any knowledge of electronics in order to make full use of this book ."
Book 1,"Neither
will you need a soldering iron, breadboard or any electronic components."
Book 1,"In short,this book is (99%) hardware free."
Book 1,"To write software for the 8051 devices considered in this book, we will use an
industry-standard (Keil) compiler."
Book 1,"To test this software, we will use a hardwaresimulator."
Book 1,Copies of both compiler tools and the simulator are included on theenclosed CD.
Book 1,"Using these tools, all of the examples in the book may be run, mod-ified and recompiled and tested, using a standard Windows PC."
Book 1,"This approach allows experienced desktop programmers to quickly understand
the key features of embedded systems before they need to ‘get their hands dirty’and build some hardware.‘I’d like to learn about embedded software, but I don’t know enough about electronics.’8322 Prelims (i-xvi)  25/2/02  3:04 pm  Page xiiiVI What’s on the CD?"
Book 1,"In addition to the Keil compiler and hardware simulator (discussed in the previous
section), the CD also includes source code files for all the examples and the casestudy: this code is in the ‘C’ programming language and is compatible with theKeil compiler."
Book 1,"The CD also contains useful information about the 8051 microcontroller
family, including a large number of relevant data sheets and application notes."
Book 1,"VII What’s the link between this book and your other 8051 book
(Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems )?"
Book 1,Embedded C provides an introduction to the use of C in embedded projects.
Book 1,"If you
want to learn more about embedded systems after you finish this book, thenPatterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems (PTTES) may be of interest."
Book 1,"1
PTTES is a large (1000-page) book which includes a comprehensive set of
‘design patterns’ to support the development of embedded systems based on the8051 family of microcontrollers."
Book 1,"In total, details of more than 70 useful patternsare provided, complete with guidelines to help you apply these techniques in yourown projects: full source code for all of the patterns is included on the PTTES CD."
Book 1,"The book includes: patterns for embedded operating systems (for both single-
processor and multi-processor applications); patterns for user-interface designsusing switches, keypads, LED and liquid crystal displays; patterns for PID control;patterns for PWM; patterns for analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue conver-sion; patterns for RS-232, RS-485, CAN, SPI and I
2C serial networks; hardware
patterns describing reset, oscillator and memory circuits."
Book 1,VIII Is the code ‘free ware’?
Book 1,The code included in this book took many years to produce.
Book 1,"It is not ‘free ware’,and is subject to some simple copyright restrictions."
Book 1,"These are as follows:
GIf you have purchased a copy of this book, you are entitled to use the codelisted in the text (and included on the CD) in your projects, should you chooseto do so."

This is a short book for people who already know how to program desktop
computers and now wish to develop software for embedded systems."
Book 1,"In this introductory chapter, we consider some important decisions that must
be made at the start of any embedded project:
GThe choice of processor."
Book 1,GThe choice of programming language.
Book 1,GThe choice of operating system.
Book 1,We begin by considering the meaning of the phrase ‘embedded system’.
Book 1,1.2 What is an embedded system?
Book 1,"When we talk about ‘embedded systems’, what do we mean?"
Book 1,Opinions vary.
Book 1,"Throughout this book, we will use the following loose definition:
1chapter1
Programming embedded
systems in C
An embedded system is an application that contains at least one programmable
computer (typically in the form of a microcontroller, a microprocessor or digitalsignal processor chip) and which is used by individuals who are, in the main,unaware that the system is computer-based."
Book 1,"8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 1Typical examples of embedded applications that are constructed using the tech-
niques discussed in this book include:
GMobile phone systems (including both customer handsets and base stations)."
Book 1,"GAutomotive applications (including braking systems, traction control, airbag
release systems, engine-management units, steer-by-wire systems and cruise-control applications)."
Book 1,"GDomestic appliances (including dishwashers, televisions, washing machines,
microwave ovens, video recorders, security systems, garage door controllers)."
Book 1,"GAerospace applications (including flight control systems, engine controllers,
autopilots and passenger in-flight entertainment systems)."
Book 1,"GMedical equipment (including anaesthesia monitoring systems, ECG moni-
tors, drug delivery systems and MRI scanners)."
Book 1,"
GDefence systems (including radar systems, fighter aircraft flight control sys-
tems, radio systems and missile guidance systems)."
Book 1,"Please note that our definition of embedded systems excludes applications such as
‘personal digital assistants’ (PDAs) running versions of Windows or similar operatingsystems: from a developer’s perspective, these are best viewed as a cut-down versionof a desktop computer system."
Book 1,This type of application makes up a very small per-centage of the overall ‘embedded’ market and is not considered in this book.
Book 1,1.3 Which processor should you use?
Book 1,"When desktop developers first think about working with embedded systems, thereis a natural inclination to stick with what they know and look for a book whichuses Pentium processors or other devices from this family (such as the 80486, orthe Intel 188)."
Book 1,"However, if you open up the engine management unit or the airbagrelease system in your car, or take the back off your dishwasher, you will not findany of these processors sitting inside, nor will there be anywhere to plug in a key-board, graphics display or mouse."
Book 1,"
Typical desktop processors cost more than US $100.00 a piece (often much
more)."
Book 1,This cost puts them out of reach of all but the most expensive embeddedapplication.
Book 1,"(Who would pay more than US $100 for a TV remote-control unit?)In addition, a desktop processor requires numerous external support chips in orderto function: this further increases the cost."
Book 1,"The additional components alsoincrease the physical size of the system, and the power consumption: both ofthese factors are major problems for battery-powered embedded devices."
Book 1,"(Who2 Embedded C8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 2would buy a portable music player that requires ten large batteries to run, and
needs a trolley to transport it?)
Overall, the state-of-the art technology used in desktop processors matches the
needs of the PC user very well: however, their key features – an ability to executeindustry-standard code at a rate of more than 1000 million instructions per second –come with a heavy price tag and are simply not required in most embedded systems."
Book 1,The 8051 device is very different.
Book 1,"It is a well-tested design, introduced in its
original form by Intel in 1980 (Figure 1.1)."
Book 1,"The development costs of this devicehave now been fully recovered, and prices of modern 8051 devices now start atless than US $1.00."
Book 1,"At this price, you get a performance of around 1 millioninstructions per second, and 256 bytes (not megabytes!) of on-chip RAM."
Book 1,"You also
get 32 port pins and a serial interface."
Book 1,"The 8051’s profile (price, performance,available memory, serial interface) match the needs of many embedded systemsvery well."
Book 1,"As a result, it is now produced in more than 400 different forms by adiverse range of companies including Philips, Infineon, Atmel and Dallas."
Book 1,"Sales ofthis vast family are estimated to have the largest share (around 60%) of the micro-controller market as a whole, and to make up more than 50% of the 8-bitmicrocontroller market."
Book 1,"Versions of the 8051 are currently used in a long list ofembedded products, from children’s toys to automotive systems."
Book 1,"Building a desktop PC from an 8051 would not be a practical proposition, but it is
an excellent device for building many embedded systems."
Book 1,One important factor isthat the 8051 requires a minimum number of external components in order tooperate.
Book 1,"For example, Figure 1.2 shows the circuit diagram for a complete 8051-based application.3 Programming embedded systems in C
FIGURE 1.1  The external interface of a ‘Standard’ ‘8051’ microcontroller (40-pin DIP package)."
Book 1,"Standard 8051s have four ports, and are pin compatible with the original 8051/8052 from Intel.Further information about the pin functions is given in Chapter 2‘8051’1

fact that some of the more recent 8051 devices – far from being more powerfuland having more features than the 1980 original – actually have fewer features."
Book 1,"For
example, as we will discuss in Chapter 2, the original 8051 (Figure 1.1) had 32 I/Opins and could – if necessary – be connected to up to 128 kbytes of externalmemory."
Book 1,"By contrast, the more recent ‘Small 8051’ devices typically have onlysome 15 I/O pins, and do not support external memory."
Book 1,"These devices are findingtheir way into applications that would have involved a small number of discretecomponents (transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors) a few years ago, but whichmay now be implemented more cheaply using microcontrollers (Figure 1.3).4 Embedded C
FIGURE 1.2 An example of an 8051 microcontroller in use."
Book 1,"In this example, the microcontroller is
intended to flash an LED connected to Pin 6."
Book 1,"In addition to this LED, only a simple ‘reset’ circuit isrequired (the capacitor and resistor connected to Pin 9), plus an external oscillator (in this case, a 3-pin ceramic resonator)."

tion areas, where limited memory is required, and one of the most importantconsiderations is product cost."
Book 1,This forms a large segment of the embedded marketbut – of course – not all projects take this form.
Book 1,"To develop applications requiringadditional hardware or larger amounts of memory, we can opt to switch to a 16-bit(or 32-bit) microcontroller environment – or even consider using a desktop micro-processor."
Book 1,"However, such a move can require a major investment in staff, trainingand development tools."
Book 1,An alternative is to use one of the Extended 8051 devicesintroduced in recent years by a range of manufacturers (see Figure 1.4).
Book 1,"
One important application area for Extended 8051s has been the automotive
sector."
Book 1,"Recent economic, legislative and technological developments in this sectormean that an increasing number of road vehicles contain embedded systems.Linking these systems together in many recent vehicles is a low-cost, two-wireController Area Network (CAN) computer bus."
Book 1,"The CAN bus eliminates the expen-sive (and heavy) multi-wire looms, shaving around US $600 or more fromproduction costs: a significant saving."
Book 1,"5 Programming embedded systems in C
FIGURE 1.3 An example of a ‘Small 8051’ in use."
Book 1,"Small 8051s are produced by Atmel and
Philips."
Book 1,"They have two ports (or less), and around 20 pins."
Book 1,"In this case, an Atmel AT89C2051 isused, in a ‘cupboard light’ application."
Book 1,"The circuit here is intended for use in a cupboard(closet), and will be battery powered."
Book 1,"When the light is switched on (by pressing the switch),it will operate for 20 seconds."
Book 1,"If, in this time, the user does not press the switch again (to turnoff the light), the power will be removed automatically."

Book 1,"In order to connect to the CAN bus, the var-
ious devices – from door mirrors to braking systems – each require an embeddedprocessor."
Book 1,"As a consequence, a modern passenger car may typically have 50processors on board."
Book 1,"To use 50 desktop chips in these circumstances, we wouldneed to spend around US $5000."
Book 1,"This cost greatly outweighs any saving achievedthrough the use of the CAN bus in the first place: in addition, the desktop proces-sor would not have on-chip support for CAN, so additional hardware would beneeded in order to provide this, further increasing our costs and design complex-ity."

Book 1,"The use of 50 such chips in a car design would not generally
cost more than US $200."
Book 1,"Using these processors, the switch to CAN may result inoverall savings of around US $400 per vehicle."
Book 1,"The final thing to note about the 8051 architecture is that, if none of the 400 or
so existing chips matches the needs of your application, you can now build yourown device."
Book 1,"For example, the Triscend
3E5 series of devices have 8051 cores, plus
an additional area of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with which you cancreate your own ‘on chip’ hardware."
Book 1,"Alternatively, for even greater flexibility,Xilinx Foundation
4provides a comprehensive set of tools for the programming of
‘blank’ FPGAs or Application-Specific ICs (ASICs)."
Book 1,Compatible with these tools area small range of 8051 ‘cores’ which can be purchased – for example – fromDolphin Integration.
Book 1,"5The use of such techniques allows you to create your own
completely customized 8051 microcontroller, in order to match precisely your par-ticular requirements."
Book 1,"
Overall, the low cost, huge range, easy availability and widespread use of the
8051 architecture makes it an excellent platform for developing embedded sys-tems: these same factors also make it an ideal platform for learning aboutembedded systems."
Book 1,"Whether you will subsequently use 8-, 16- or 32-bit embeddedprocessors, learning to work within the performance and memory limits of devicessuch as the 8051 is a crucial requirement in the cost-conscious embedded market.You simply cannot acquire these skills by developing code for a Pentium (or simi-lar desktop) processor."
Book 1,1.4 Which programming language should you use?
Book 1,"Having decided to use an 8051 processor as the basis of your embedded system,the next key decision that needs to be made is the choice of programming lan-guage."
Book 1,"In order to identify a suitable language for embedded systems, we mightbegin by making the following observations:
GComputers (such as microcontroller, microprocessor or DSP chips) only acceptinstructions in ‘machine code’ (‘object code’)."
Book 1,"Machine code is, by definition, inthe language of the computer, rather than that of the programmer."
Book 1,Interpretationof the code by the programmer is difficult and error prone.
Book 1,"
GAll software, whether in assembly, C, C++, Java or Ada must ultimately be trans-lated into machine code in order to be executed by the computer.7 Programming embedded systems in C

Book 1, www.xilinx.com  5.
Book 1," www.dolphin.fr8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 7GThere is no point in creating ‘perfect’ source code, if we then make use of a poor
translator program (such as an assembler or compiler) and thereby generateexecutable code that does not operate as we intended."
Book 1,"
GEmbedded processors – like the 8051 – have limited processor power and verylimited memory available: the language used must be efficient."
Book 1,"GTo program embedded systems, we need low-level access to the hardware: thismeans, at least, being able to read from and write to particular memory loca-tions (using ‘pointers’ or an equivalent mechanism)."
Book 1,"Of course, not all of the issues involved in language selection are purely technical:
GNo software company remains in business for very long if it generates new code,
from scratch, for every project."
Book 1,"The language used must support the creation offlexible libraries, making it easy to re-use (well-tested) code components in arange of projects."
Book 1,It must also be possible to adapt complete code systems towork with a new or updated processor with minimal difficulty.
Book 1,GStaff members change and existing personnel have limited memory spans.
Book 1,"Atthe same time, systems evolve and processors are updated."
Book 1,"As concern over the‘Year 2000’ problem in recent years has illustrated, many embedded systemshave a long lifespan."
Book 1,"During this time, their code will often have to be main-tained."
Book 1,"Good code must therefore be easy to understand now, and in five years’time (and not just by those who first wrote it)."
Book 1,"
GThe language chosen should be in common use."
Book 1,This will ensure that you cancontinue to recruit experienced developers who have knowledge of the lan-guage.
Book 1,"It will also mean that your existing developers will have access to sourcesof information (such as books, training courses, WWW sites) which give exam-ples of good design and programming practice."
Book 1,"Even this short list immediately raises the paradox of programming language
selection."
Book 1,"From one point of view, only machine code is safe, since every otherlanguage involves a translator, and any code you create is only as safe as the codewritten by the manufacturers of the translator."
Book 1,"On the other hand, real code needsto be maintained and re-used in new projects, possibly on different hardware: fewpeople would argue that machine code is easy to understand, debug or to port."
Book 1,"
Inevitably, therefore, we need to make compromises; there is no perfect solu-
tion."
Book 1,"All we can really say is that we require a language that is efficient, high-level,gives low-level access to hardware, and is well defined."
Book 1,In addition – of course –the language must be available for the platforms we wish to use.
Book 1,"Against all ofthese points, C scores well."
Book 1,"We can summarize C’s features as follows:8 Embedded C8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 8GIt is ‘mid-level’, with ‘high-level’ features (such as support for functions and
modules), and ‘low-level’ features (such as good access to hardware via pointers)."
Book 1,GIt is very efficient.
Book 1,GIt is popular and well understood.
Book 1,GEven desktop developers who have used only Java or C++ can soon understandC syntax.
Book 1,"GGood, well-proven compilers are available for every embedded processor (8-bitto 32-bit or more)."
Book 1,GExperienced staff are available.
Book 1,"GBooks, training courses, code samples and WWW sites discussing the use of thelanguage are all widely available."
Book 1,"Overall, C’s strengths for embedded system development greatly outweigh its
weaknesses."
Book 1,"It may not be an ideal language for developing embedded systems,but it is unlikely that a ‘perfect’ language will ever be created."
Book 1,"
1.5 Which operating system should you use?"
Book 1,"Having opted to create our 8051-based applications using C, we can now begin toconsider how this language can be used."
Book 1,"In doing so, we will begin to probe some ofthe differences between software development for desktop and embedded systems."
Book 1,"In the desktop environment, the program the user requires (such as a word
processor program) is usually loaded from disk on demand, along with anyrequired data (such as a word processor file)."
Book 1,Figure 1.5 shows a typical operatingenvironment for such a word processor.
Book 1,Here the system is well insulated from theunderlying hardware.
Book 1,"For example, when the user wishes to save his or her latestnovel on disk, the word processor delegates most of the necessary work to theoperating system, which in turn may delegate many of the hardware-specific com-mands to the BIOS (basic input/output system)."
Book 1,The desktop PC does not require an operating system (or BIOS).
Book 1,"However, for most
users, the main advantage of a personal computer is its flexibility: that is, that thesame piece of equipment has the potential to run many thousands of different pro-grams."
Book 1,"If the PC had no operating system, each of these programs would need to beable to carry out all the low-level functions for itself."
Book 1,This would be very inefficientand would tend to make systems more expensive.
Book 1,"It would also be likely to lead toerrors, as many simple functions would have to be duplicated in even the smallest ofprograms."
Book 1,"One way of viewing this is that a desktop PC is used to run multiple pro-grams, and the operating system provides the ‘common code’ (for printing, filestorage, graphics, and so forth) that is required by this set of programs."
Book 1,"9 Programming embedded systems in C8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 9There are two fundamental differences between the embedded systems we are con-
cerned with in this book and desktop computer systems:
1The vast majority of embedded systems are required to run only one program:
this program will start running when the microcontroller is powered up, andwill stop running when the power is removed."
Book 1,"
2Many of the facilities provided by the modern desktop OS – such as the ability
to display high-resolution graphics, printing facilities and efficient disk access –are of little value in embedded systems, where sophisticated graphics screens,printers and disks are generally unavailable."
Book 1,"
As a consequence, the simplest architecture in an embedded system is typically a
form of ‘Super Loop’ (see Listing 1.1)."
Book 1,"Listing 1.1 Part of a simple Super Loop demonstration
void main(void)
{// Prepare run function XX_Init();
while(1) // ‘for ever’ (Super Loop)
{X(); // Run function X()}

Book 1,"When
power is applied to the system, the function main() will be called: having per-
formed the initializations, the function X() will be called, repeatedly, until the
system is disconnected from the power supply (or a serious error occurs)."
Book 1,"For example, suppose we wish to develop a microcontroller-based control
system to be used as part of the central-heating system in a building."
Book 1,"The simplestversion of this system might consist of a gas-fired boiler (which we wish to con-trol), a sensor (measuring room temperature), a temperature dial (through whichthe desired temperature is specified) and the controller itself (Figure 1.6)."
Book 1,"We assume that the boiler, temperature sensor and temperature dial are connected
to the system via appropriate ports."
Book 1,"
Here, precise timing is not required, and a Super Loop framework similar to that
shown in Listing 1.2 may be appropriate."
Book 1,"Listing 1.2 Part of the code for a simple central-heating system

It should be noted that the Super Loop architecture employed in this central-
heating system is not appropriate for all embedded applications."
Book 1,"For moreadvanced applications, we will describe how to create your own embedded operat-ing system in Chapter 7."
Book 1,"
1.6 How do you develop embedded software?"
Book 1,"The process of compiling, linking and executing the program shown (in part) inListing 1.2 on a desktop PC is straightforward."
Book 1,"In this environment, the executablecode we create will, in almost all cases, be intended to run on a desktop computersimilar to the one on which the code development is carried out."
Book 1,In the embeddedenvironment this is rarely the case.
Book 1,"For example, the 8051 devices we will usethroughout this book do not have sufficient memory resources to allow them tobe used for compiling programs, and they will not support a keyboard or graphicsdisplay."
Book 1,"As a result, the code will be ‘cross-compiled’ on a desktop PC, generatingmachine code that is compatible with the 8051 family: this process will be exam-ined in greater detail in Chapter 3."
Book 1,"Having created the required executable code, we need to test it and refine it."
Book 1,"To
do this, we need to do the following:
1Build the hardware for the embedded system."
Book 1,"2Transfer the executable code to the embedded hardware and test the system.12 Embedded C8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 12For programmers without experience of electronics, the process of building
embedded hardware is a daunting one."
Book 1,A typical approach used to prototype smallembedded applications is the ‘breadboard’.
Book 1,"This allows the microcontroller andassociated components to be connected together, without soldering, in order totest and refine the hardware and software design."
Book 1,"For example, consider the breadboard shown in Figure 1.7. This code is for a
simple alarm clock with an LED display and some switches to adjust the time andalarm settings."
Book 1,"As the photograph makes clear, even in this simple applicationthere are many opportunities for wiring errors."
Book 1,As a result – if the system does notoperate correctly – it may not be clear whether this is as a result of software errorsor hardware problems.
Book 1,"A means of transferring the program code to the microcontroller is also
required."
Book 1,"In examples such as the alarm clock shown in Figure 1.7, the microcon-troller used will typically incorporate some form of ‘flash’ memory to store theprogram code."
Book 1,"6To transfer the executable code to the microcontroller, we will use
a ‘flash’ programmer."
Book 1,"Flexible programmers (for use with the whole family of 8051processors, and other devices) may cost several hundred dollars."
Book 1,"Alternatively,‘hobby’ developers often choose to save money by developing their own program-mer at home: however, to do this, experience of electronics constructiontechniques is required."
Book 1,"Overall, the process of wiring up a breadboard to test your first simple embedded
programs can be daunting, expensive and rather prone to error."
Book 1,"Fortunately, thereis now an alternative approach that can be used by those starting out in this area:13 Programming embedded systems in C
6."
Book 1,We will consider the different types of available memory in greater detail in Chapter 2.FIGURE 1.7 An example of a simple 8051-based alarm clock assembled on a breadboard.
Book 1,"The board was assembled by Neeraj Kachhwaha, Bresley Lim, Melvin Lim and Henry Tam."

8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 131Create the executable code for the embedded system on a desktop PC using an
appropriate cross-compiler and related tools (as above)."
Book 1,2Use a software simulator (running on the desktop PC) to test the code.
Book 1,"3Repeat Step 1 and Step 2, as necessary, until the software operates as required."
Book 1,"Throughout this book we will use such a simulator, produced by Keil Software."
Book 1,"This
provides you with a very flexible ‘hardware’ platform, on which you can gain expe-rience of embedded software without simultaneously having to learn how to solder."
Book 1,A copy of this simulator is included on the enclosed CD.
Book 1,"Please note that this is
an evaluation version of the simulator and has some restrictions compared withthe full version: nonetheless, it can be used to run all of the examples in this book.We describe how to use this simulator in Chapter 3."
Book 1,"An example of the simulator in use is given in Figure 1.8. As we will see in sub-
sequent chapters, this simulator accurately reproduces the activity of all keycomponents in various members of the 8051 family.14 Embedded C
FIGURE 1.8 The Keil 8051 hardware simulator in use."
Book 1,"We discuss the use of this simulator in
detail in Chapter 3
8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 14Please note that these simulators are not simply ‘toys’ to be used only when learn-
ing how to develop embedded software."
Book 1,"Even where hardware will be constructed,most developers will conduct early software tests on a simulator before using thehardware."
Book 1,This can greatly speed up the development process.
Book 1,"For example, inapplications using a serial interface (see Chapter 9), the simulator can determinethe precise baud rate being generated by your software: this can avoid many sub-sequent problems."
Book 1,"In addition, the simulator provides key facilities for debugging,such as support for ‘profiling’ the code, a process that will typically involve meas-uring the duration of particular functions."
Book 1,"As we will see in subsequent chapters,timing plays a central role in most embedded applications, and the ability tomeasure function durations in a straightforward way makes the simulator a keydebugging tool."
Book 1,"1.7 Conclusions
In this introductory chapter, we have considered:
GThe type of embedded systems that will be discussed in this book."
Book 1,GThe choice of programming language for embedded systems.
Book 1,GThe choice of operating system for embedded systems.
Book 1,GThe process of creating executable code for an embedded processor on a desktop PC.

Book 1,"In the next chapter, we will look more closely at the features of the 8051
microcontroller.15 Programming embedded systems in C8322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 1518322 Chapter 1 p1-16  21/2/02  9:52 am  Page 162.1 Introduction
In Chapter 1, we looked at some of the key features of ‘embedded’ software."
Book 1,"In the
remainder of the book, our focus will be on 8051-based embedded systems."
Book 1,"In this chapter, we consider some of the key features of the 8051 family."
Book 1,2.2 What’s in a name?
Book 1,"Before we look in more detail at the features of the various 8051 devices, weshould note that the names given to the various family members is always asource of confusion to new developers."
Book 1,"For example, the 8031, 8751, 8052, 8032,C505C, C515C, C509, C868, 80C517, 83C452, 80C390, ADµC812 and MAX7651are all members of the 8051 family."
Book 1,The names of the devices provide little or noindication of the family connections.
Book 1,Particular confusion arises over the labels ‘8051’ and ‘8052’.
Book 1,"The 8052 was
launched (by Intel) shortly after the 8051 appeared."
Book 1,"The architecture was thesame, except that the 8052 had more on-chip RAM (256 bytes cf."
Book 1,"128 bytes), andalso had an additional timer (Timer 2)."
Book 1,"
You should be aware that, despite the fact that they are described as ‘8051s’,
almost all current devices are based on the slightly later 8052 architecture
."
Book 1,"As
the distinction between ‘8051’ and ‘8052’ is now purely of historical interest, wewill follow this convention and use the label ‘8051’ throughout this book."
Book 1,"If you want more information about the various 8051 devices that are available,
you will find a large number of relevant data sheets on the CD."
Book 1,"In addition, Keil

Book 1,"8
2.3 The external interface of the Standard 8051
As we saw in Chapter 1, the 400 different devices in the 8051 family can bedivided into three main groups: the Standard 8051s, the Small 8051s and theExtended 8051s (Figure 2.1)."

All digital computer systems are driven by some form of oscillator circuit: the 8051
is certainly no exception (see Figure 2.4)."
Book 1,"
The oscillator circuit is the ‘heartbeat’ of the system and is crucial to correct
operation."
Book 1,"For example, if the oscillator fails, the system will not function at all;if the oscillator runs irregularly, any timing calculations performed by the systemwill be inaccurate."
Book 1,"
We consider some important issues linked to oscillator frequency and perform-
ance in this section."
Book 1,"a) The link between oscillator frequency and machine-cycle period
One of the first questions to be asked when considering a microcontroller for aproject is whether it has the required level of performance."
Book 1,"
As a general rule, the speed at which your application runs is directly determined
by the oscillator frequency: in most cases, if you double the oscillator frequency,the application will run twice as fast."
Book 1,"When we want to compare different proces-sors, we need a way of specifying performance in a quantitative manner."
Book 1,"Onepopular measure is the number of machine instructions that may be executed inone second, usually expressed in ‘MIPS’ (Million Instructions Per Second)."
Book 1,"Forexample, in the original Intel 8051 microcontroller, a minimum of 12 oscillatorcycles was required to execute a machine instruction."
Book 1,"The original 8051 had a max-imum oscillator frequency of 12 MHz and therefore a peak performance of 1 MIP.21 Introducing the 8051 microcontroller family
FIGURE 2.4 An example of a simple crystal oscillator circuit."

XLTL127 pF
27 pF8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:54 am  Page 21A simple way of improving the 8051 performance is to increase the clock fre-
quency."
Book 1,More modern (Standard) 8051 devices allow the use of clock speeds wellbeyond the 12 MHz limit of the original devices.
Book 1,"For example, the AtmelAT89C55WD, allow clock speeds up to 33 MHz: this raises the peak performanceto around 3 MIPS."
Book 1,"
Another way of improving the performance is to make internal changes to the
microcontroller so that fewer oscillator cycles are required to execute eachmachine instruction."
Book 1,"The Dallas ‘High Speed Microcontroller’ devices (87C520,and similar) use this approach, so that only four oscillator cycles are required toexecute a machine instruction."
Book 1,These Dallas devices also allow faster clock rates(typically up to 33 MHz).
Book 1,"Combined, these changes give a total performance ofaround 8 MIPS."
Book 1,"Similar changes are made in members of the Winbond family ofStandard 8051 devices (see the Winbond W77E58, for example) resulting in per-formance figures of up to 10 MIPS."
Book 1,"
Clearly, for maximum performance, we would like to execute instructions at a
rate of one machine instruction per oscillator cycle."
Book 1,"For example, the Dallas ‘UltraHigh Speed’ 89C420 operates at this rate: as a result, it runs at 12 times the speedof the original 8051."
Book 1,"In addition, the 89c420 can operate at up to 50 MHz, increas-ing overall performance to around 40–50 MIPS."
Book 1,"
To put all these figures in perspective, a modern desktop PC has a potential per-
formance of around 1000 MIPS."
Book 1,"However, a good percentage of this performance(perhaps 50% or more) will be ‘consumed’ by the operating system."
Book 1,"By contrast,the embedded operating system we will describe in Chapter 7 consumes less than1% of the processor resources of the most basic 8051: this leaves sufficient CPUcycles to run a complex embedded application."
Book 1,"b) Why you should choose a low oscillator frequency
In our experience, many developers select an oscillator frequency that is at or nearthe maximum value supported by a particular device."
Book 1,"For example, the InfineonC505/505C will operate with crystal frequency of 2–20 MHz, and many peopleautomatically choose values at or near the top of this range, in order to gain max-imum performance."
Book 1,"This can be a mistake, for the following reasons:
GMany applications do not require the levels of performance that a modern 8051device can provide."
Book 1,"GIn most modern (CMOS-based) 8051s, there is an almost linear relationshipbetween the oscillator frequency and the power supply current."
Book 1,"As a result, byusing the lowest frequency necessary it is possible to reduce the power require-ment: this can be useful, particularly in battery-powered applications.22 Embedded C8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:54 am  Page 22GWhen accessing low-speed peripherals (such as slow memory, or liquid-crystal
displays), programming and hardware design can be greatly simplified – andthe cost of peripheral components, such as memory latches, can be reduced – ifthe chip is operating more slowly."
Book 1,GThe electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by a circuit increases withclock frequency.
Book 1,"
In general, you should operate at the lowest possible oscillator frequency compati-
ble with the performance needs of your application."
Book 1,"As we will see in laterchapters, simulating the processor is a good way of determining the required oper-ating frequency for a particular application."
Book 1,"2.6 Memory Issues
We consider some of the memory issues relating to the 8051 in this section."
Book 1,"
a) Types of memory
On the desktop, most designers and programmers can safely ignore the type ofmemory they are using."
Book 1,"This is seldom the case in embedded environments, andwe therefore briefly review some of the different types of memory below."
Book 1,"First, a short history lesson, to explain the roots of an important acronym."
Book 1,"On
early mainframe and desktop computer systems, long-term data storage was car-ried out using computer tapes."
Book 1,"Reading or writing to the tape took varyingamounts of time, depending whether it involved, for example, rewinding theentire tape, or simply rewinding a couple of centimetres."
Book 1,"In this context, newmemory devices appeared that could be used to store data while the computer wasrunning, but which lost these data when the power was removed."
Book 1,"These read-writememory devices were referred to as ‘random access memory’ (RAM) devices,because – unlike tape-based systems – accessing any element of memory ‘chosen atrandom’ took the same amount of time."
Book 1,"
Tapes have now largely disappeared, but the acronym RAM has not, and is still
used to refer to memory devices that can be both read from and written to.However, since RAM was first introduced, new forms of memory devices haveappeared, including various forms of ROM (read-only memory)."
Book 1,"Since these ROMdevices are also ‘random access’ in nature, the acronym RAM is now best trans-lated as ‘Read-Write Memory’."
Book 1,"23 Introducing the 8051 microcontroller family8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:54 am  Page 23Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
Dynamic RAM is a read-write memory technology that uses a small capacitor to
store information."
Book 1,"As the capacitor will discharge quite rapidly, it must be fre-quently refreshed to maintain the required information: circuitry on the chiptakes care of this refresh activity."
Book 1,"Like most current forms of RAM, the informationis lost when power is removed from the chip."
Book 1,"Static RAM (SRAM)
Static RAM is a read-write memory technology that uses a form of electronic flip-flop to store the information."
Book 1,"No refreshing is required, but the circuitry is morecomplex and costs can be several times that of the corresponding size of DRAM.However, access times may be one-third those of DRAM."
Book 1,"Mask Read-Only Memory (ROM)
Mask ROM is – from the software developer’s perspective – read only: however,the manufacturer is able to write to the memory, at the time the chip is created,according to a ‘mask’ provided by the company for which the chips are beingproduced."
Book 1,Such devices are therefore sometimes referred to as ‘factory-programmed ROM’.
Book 1,"Mask programming is not cheap, and is not a low-volumeoption: mistakes can be very expensive, and providing code for your first maskcan be a character-building process."
Book 1,Access times are often slower than RAM:roughly 1.5 times that of DRAM.
Book 1,"Many members of the 8051 family are available with on-chip, mask-
programmed, ROM."
Book 1,"
Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM)
PROM is a form of Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM) or ‘One-Time Programmable’(OTP) memory."
Book 1,"Basically, we use a PROM programmer to blow tiny ‘fuses’ in thedevice."
Book 1,"Once blown, these fuses cannot be repaired; however, the devices them-selves are cheap."
Book 1,Many modern members of the 8051 family are available with OTP ROM.
Book 1,"
UV Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (UV EPROM)
Like PROMs, UV EPROMs are programmed electrically."
Book 1,"Unlike PROMs, they alsohave a quartz window which allows the memory to be erased by exposing theinternals of the device to UV light."
Book 1,"The erasure process can take several minutesand, after erasure, the quartz window will be covered with a UV-opaque label."
Book 1,Thisform of EPROM can withstand thousands of program / erase cycles.
Book 1,"24 Embedded C8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:54 am  Page 24More flexible than PROMs and once very common, UV EPROMs now seem
rather primitive compared with EEPROMs (see below)."
Book 1,They can be useful for pro-totyping but are prohibitively expensive for use in production.
Book 1,Many older members of the 8051 family are available with on-board UV EPROM.
Book 1,"
EEPROM and Flash ROM
Electrically-Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROMs) and ‘Flash’ROMs are a more user-friendly form of ROM that can be both programmed anderased electrically."
Book 1,"
EEPROM and Flash ROM are very similar."
Book 1,"EEPROMs can usually be re-
programmed on a byte-by-byte basis, and are often used to store passwords orother ‘persistent’ user data."
Book 1,Flash ROMs generally require a block-sized ‘erase’ oper-ation before they can be programmed: often the size of the block will be severalkilobytes: such ROMs are often used for the storage of program code.
Book 1,"Many members of the 8051 family are available with on-board EEPROM or flash
ROM, and some devices contain both types of memory."
Book 1,"
b) Memory organization and ‘hex’
As you will recall, all data items are represented in computer memory as binarycodes, each containing a certain number of bits."
Book 1,"To simplify the storage and retrievalof data items, these memory bits are organized into memory locations, each with aunique memory address."
Book 1,"In a common byte-oriented memory (as used in desktopPCs and – with some exceptions – in the 8051), each memory location containseight bits (one byte) of storage, and each byte has a unique address (Figure 2.5).25 Introducing the 8051 microcontroller family

has its own unique address, shown in hexadecimal notation here."

Book 1,"Table 2.1 shows a list of numbers with their hex, binary and ‘ordinary’ decimal
representations."
Book 1,"c) The 8051 memory architecture
Having considered some of the basic memory types available and some generalfeatures of computer memory organization, we are now in a position to considerthe memory architecture of the 8051."
Book 1,"
There are two distinct memory regions in an 8051 device: the DATA area and
the CODE area."
Book 1,We will consider each region in turn here.
Book 1,"DATA memory
DATA memory is used to store variables and the program stack while the programis running."
Book 1,The DATA area will be implemented using some form of RAM.
Book 1,"
Most of the DATA area has a byte-oriented memory organization."
Book 1,"However,
within the DATA area is a 16-byte BDATA area which can also be accessed using bitaddresses."
Book 1,This area can be used to store bit-sized variables (see Figure 2.6).
Book 1,The8051 has machine instructions which allow bit variables to be manipulated veryefficiently.
Book 1,"These instructions can be easily utilized from C, as we will demonstratein Chapter 3.26 Embedded C
TABLE 2.1 Different number representations."
Book 1,"See text for details

(0x20 to 0x2F) or via their bit addresses (0x00 to 0x7F)."
Book 1,"Note also that there is an area where the bit addresses and the byte addresses are
the same."
Book 1,"For example, within byte address 0x24, there is a bit location withaddress 0x27: there is also a byte with address 0x27 in the BDATA area."
Book 1,It mayappear that this will cause problems for the compiler.
Book 1,"However, no conflicts willarise because the compiler can always determine from the context (that is, the typeof data being manipulated) whether the bit address or byte address should be used."
Book 1,"CODE memory
Not surprisingly, the CODE area is used to store the program code, usually in someform of ROM (’read-only memory’)."
Book 1,"
Please note:
GThe CODE area may also contain read-only variables (‘constants’), such as filterco-efficients or data for speech playback."
Book 1,"
GOn a desktop PC, code is copied from disk to RAM when you run the program.It is then executed from RAM."

Book 1,"See text for details8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 27GOne consequence of the ‘execute in place’ operation is that, in most applica-
tions, while you may require up to 10 kbytes of CODE memory, you will rarelyneed much DATA memory."
Book 1,"This is reflected in the fact that many 8051 deviceshave 20 kbytes or more of on-chip ROM, but will often have no more than 256bytes of RAM."
Book 1,This is an appropriate mix for most general applications.
Book 1,"d) 8-bit family, 16-bit address space
The Standard 8051 can be described as an 8-bit microcontroller with a 16-bitaddress space."
Book 1,"
Here the fact that it is an ‘8-bit microcontroller’ refers to the size of the registers
and data bus."
Book 1,This means that the family will handle 8-bit data very quickly andprocess 16-bit or 32-bit data rather less efficiently.
Book 1,"The 16-bit address space means that the device can directly address 2
16bytes of
memory: that is, 64 kbytes."
Book 1,Note that the (Harvard-like) architecture of the 8051means that it can access both 64 kbytes of CODE memory and 64 kbytes of DATAmemory.
Book 1,"These figures refer to the total amount of memory you can access: toreach these limits, you will need to connect memory devices to the external inter-face (Figure 2.7).28 Embedded C
FIGURE 2.7 The 8051 external memory interface."
Book 1,"Use of this external memory interface
involves the use of the whole of Port 0 and Port 2, plus some of Port 3."

Book 1,"
Finally, please note that – while all 8051s are 8-bit microcontrollers – some
more recent devices (like the Dallas 80c390) support an address space greater than16 bits."
Book 1,This allows access to much larger amounts of memory.
Book 1,Please refer to the80c390 data sheet (on the CD) for details.
Book 1,"2.7 I/O pins
Much of the activity in embedded systems involves reading pins (which may, forexample, be connected to switches or keypads) and altering the value of other pins(which may, in turn, control anything, from an LED to a 5-tonne industrial robot).The 8051 architecture has a number of features which make it very well suited tosuch applications."
Book 1,"Most 8051s have four 8-bit ports, giving a total of 32 pins you can individually
read from or control."
Book 1,"All of the ports are bidirectional: that is, they may be used forboth input and output."
Book 1,"To limit the size of the device, some of the port pins havealternate functions."
Book 1,"For example, as we saw in the previous section, Ports 0, 2 (andpart of Port 3) together provide the address and data bus used to support access toexternal memory."
Book 1,"Similarly, two further pins on Port 3 (Pin 16 and Pin 17) also pro-vide access to the on-chip UART (see Section 2.10)."
Book 1,"When in their ‘alternativeroles’, these pins cannot be used for ordinary input or output."
Book 1,"For example, if usinga Standard 8051 device with external memory, Port 1 is the only (complete) portavailable for general-purpose I/O operations."
Book 1,"
The comments above all refer to the Standard 8051: the number of available
ports on 8051 microcontrollers varies enormously: the Small 8051s have theequivalent of approximately two ports, and the Extended 8051s have up to tenports."
Book 1,"Despite these differences, the control of ports on all members of the 8051family is carried out in the same way."
Book 1,"We will consider how to use the port pins for input and output in Chapter 3
and Chapter 4."
Book 1,"2.8 Timers
All members of the 8051 family have at least two timer/counters, known as Timer0 and Timer 1: most also have an additional timer (Timer 2)."
Book 1,"These are 16-bittimers, which means they can hold values from 0 to 65535 (decimal).29 Introducing the 8051 microcontroller family8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 29Timers like these are crucial to the development of embedded systems."
Book 1,"To see
why, you need to appreciate that, when configured appropriately, the timers areincremented periodically: specifically, in most 8051 devices, the timers are incre-mented every 12 oscillator cycles."
Book 1,"Thus, assuming we have a 12 MHz oscillator,the timer will be incremented 1 million times per second."
Book 1,"There are many things we can do with such a timer:
GWe can use it to measure intervals of time."
Book 1,"For example, we can measure theduration of a function by noting the value of a timer at the beginning and endof the function call, and comparing the two results."
Book 1,"GWe can use it to generate precise hardware delays, as we discuss in Chapter 6."
Book 1,GWe can use it to generate ‘time out’ facilities: this is a key requirement in sys-tems with real-time constraints (see Chapter 6).
Book 1,"GMost important of all, we can use it to generate regular ‘ticks’, and drive anoperating system: we say a little more about this in the next section."
Book 1,"2.9 Interrupts
If you were to ask developers who are experienced in embedded systems to sum upin one word the difference between desktop software and embedded software,many would probably choose the word ‘interrupt’."
Book 1,"From a low-level perspective, an interrupt is a hardware mechanism used to
notify a processor that an ‘event’ has taken place: such events may be ‘internal’events (such as the overflow of a timer) or ‘external’ events (such as the arrival of acharacter through a serial interface)."
Book 1,"
Viewed from a high-level perspective, interrupts provide a mechanism for creat-
ing multitasking applications: that is applications which, apparently, perform morethan one task at a time using a single processor."
Book 1,"To illustrate this, a schematic repre-sentation of interrupt handling in an embedded system is shown in Figure 2.8. 
In Figure 2.8 the system executes two (background) functions, Function 1 and
Function 2."
Book 1,"During the execution of Function 1, an interrupt is raised, and an‘interrupt service routine’ (ISR1) deals with this event."
Book 1,"After the execution of ISR1is complete, Function 1 resumes its operation."
Book 1,"During the execution of Function 2,another interrupt is raised, this time dealt with by ISR2."
Book 1,"
The original ‘8051’ (‘8052’) architecture supported seven interrupt sources:
9
GTwo or three timer/counter interrupts (related to Timer 0, Timer 1 and – in the8052 – Timer 2).30 Embedded C
9."
Book 1,"More recent devices support larger numbers of interrupts without altering the core architecture.8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 30GTwo UART-related interrupts (note: these share the same interrupt vector, and
can be viewed as a single interrupt source)."
Book 1,GTwo external interrupts.
Book 1,"In addition, there is one further interrupt source over which the programmer has
minimal control:
GThe ‘power-on reset’ (POR) interrupt."
Book 1,"When an interrupt is generated, the processor ‘jumps’ to an address at the bottom
of the CODE memory area."
Book 1,These locations must contain suitable code with whichthe microcontroller can respond to the interrupt.
Book 1,"In most cases, the locations willinclude another ‘jump’ instruction, giving the address of suitable ‘interrupt serviceroutine’ located elsewhere in (CODE) memory."
Book 1,"
This process may sound complicated but, from the perspective of the C pro-
grammer, an interrupt service routine is simply a function that is ‘called by themicrocontroller’, as a result of a particular hardware event."
Book 1,"As we will see in laterchapters, use of interrupts in a high-level language is a straightforward process.31 Introducing the 8051 microcontroller family

ISR 18322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 31As we noted above, three of the ‘8051 / 8052’ interrupt sources are associated
with on-chip timers."
Book 1,This is because such timers are a particularly effective andwidely-used source of interrupts.
Book 1,"For example, we can use such timers to gener-ate an interrupt (a ‘tick’) at regular and precise intervals of (say) 1 millisecond.As we will see in Chapter 7, such ‘timer ticks’ form the basis of all real-timeoperating systems."
Book 1,"2.10 Serial interface
The 8051 has a serial port compatible with what is commonly referred to as theRS-232 communication protocol."
Book 1,"This allows you to transfer data between an 8051microcontroller and some form of personal computer (desktop PC, notebook PCor similar)."
Book 1,"Such an interface is common in embedded processors, and is widely used."
Book 1,"Here
are some examples:
GThe serial port may be used to debug embedded applications, using a desktop PC."
Book 1,GThe serial port may be used to load code into flash memory for ‘in circuit pro-gramming’.
Book 1,"This can be very useful, for example, when code must be updated‘in situ’ (for example, when the product is already installed in a vehicle, or on aproduction line)."
Book 1,"GThe serial port may be used to transfer data from embedded data acquisitionsystems to a PC, or to other embedded processors."
Book 1,We will consider the use of the serial interface in detail in Chapter 9.
Book 1,"2.11 Power consumption
The final issue we need to address is power consumption."
Book 1,"On a desktop PC, processor power consumption is not generally a major con-
cern."
Book 1,"In such an environment, the typical CRT-based screen, DVD/CD drive andhard disk will consume much more power than the processor itself: efforts atsaving power therefore tend to focus on ‘shutting down’ peripheral componentsrather than optimizing the processor itself."
Book 1,"The embedded environment is very different, particularly where battery-
powered applications are being developed."
Book 1,"In such applications, the microcontrolleris often the main drain on our battery power."
Book 1,"To achieve longer battery life, allmodern implementations of 8051 processors have at least three operating modes:32 Embedded C8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 32GNormal mode."
Book 1,GIdle Mode.
Book 1,GPower-Down Mode.
Book 1,"The ‘Idle’ and ‘Power Down’ modes are intended to be used to save power at times
when no processing is required."
Book 1,Typical current requirements for the variousmodes are shown in Table 2.2. Note that the original ‘Intel 8051’ figure (for the1980 processor) is shown for comparative purposes: this did not have power-saving modes.
Book 1,"To put these figures in context, bear in mind that – for reasonable battery life – we
generally aim for an average power consumption of less than 10 mA."
Book 1,"As the tablemakes clear, this means that operating in ‘Normal’ mode for extended periods isnot a practical option."
Book 1,"The Infineon C501 is an example of a Standard 8051 device, which offers
power-down modes identical to those available in the 8052 and many othermodern devices."
Book 1,"The following description of the C501 idle modes, adapted fromthe user manual, describes these modes in detail."
Book 1,Please note that this descriptionapplies equally well to most Standard 8051s.
Book 1,"a) Idle mode
In the idle mode the oscillator of the C501 continues to run, but the CPU is gatedoff from the clock signal."
Book 1,"However, the interrupt system, the serial port and alltimers are connected to the clock."
Book 1,The CPU status is preserved in its entirety.
Book 1,"The reduction of power consumption which can be achieved by this feature
depends on the number of peripherals running."
Book 1,"If all timers are stopped and theserial interface is not running, the maximum power reduction can be achieved:the developer has to determine which peripheral must continue to run and whichmay be stopped."
Book 1,"33 Introducing the 8051 microcontroller family
TABLE 2.2 Typical current consumption figures for a selection of Standard 8051 devices."
Book 1,"Note that figures vary (approximately linearly) with oscillator frequency: in this case, the clock
frequency is assumed at 12 MHz for each device
Device Normal Idle Power Down
Intel 8051 160 mA - -
Atmel 89S53 11 mA 2 mA 60 uA

Intel 80C51 16 mA 4 mA 50 µA8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 33The idle mode is entered by setting the flag bit IDLE (PCON.0)."
Book 1,"The easiest way
to set the IDLE bit is with the following ‘C’ statement:
PCON |= 0x01; // Enter idle mode
There are two ways to terminate idle mode:
GActivate any enabled interrupt."
Book 1,"This interrupt will be serviced and the program
will continue by executing the instruction following the instruction that setsthe IDLE bit."
Book 1,GPerform a hardware reset.
Book 1,"
b) Power-down mode
In the power-down mode, the on-chip oscillator is stopped."
Book 1,Therefore all func-tions are stopped; only the contents of the on-chip RAM are maintained.
Book 1,"
The power-down mode is entered by setting the flag bit PDE (PCON.1)."
Book 1,"This is
most easily done in ‘C’ as follows:
PCON |= 0x02; // Enter power-down mode
The only exit from power-down mode is a hardware reset."
Book 1,"
2.12 Conclusions
All members of the 8051 family provide the hardware components – multiple port
pins, timers, interrupt handling, serial interface and memory – required in embed-ded applications."
Book 1,We will describe how to make full use of these components in theremainder of this book.
Book 1,"In Chapter 3, we describe how the operation of the 8051 can be simulated on a
desktop PC.34 Embedded C8322 Chapter 2 p17-34  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 343.1 Introduction
When you first started programming a desktop computer, you probably wrote a pro-
gram similar to the example shown in Listing 3.1 for every language you learned."

controller."
Book 1,"Like the desktop program, this will be designed to introduce key featuresof the development tools and the environment."
Book 1,"Unlike the desktop version, wehave no screen on which to display text (Figure 3.1): instead, the code will bedesigned to flash an LED on for one second, off for one second, ad infinitum ."
Book 1,"The program we will use to do this is shown (in part) in Listing 3.2.
Listing 3.2 Part of the ‘Hello, Embedded World’ example code

{LED_FLASH_Init();

{// Change the LED state (OFF to ON, or vice versa)LED_FLASH_Change_State();

}
We begin by considering the Keil tools that will be used to develop this software."
Book 1,We will then consider the various components of the program in detail.
Book 1,"
3.2 Installing the Keil software and loading the project
To make full use of the material in this chapter, you need to install the Keil C51development tools: these are included on the CD."
Book 1,Please refer to the CD for details.
Book 1,"Note: the example projects for this book are NOT loaded automatically when
you install the Keil compiler."
Book 1,"Instead, these files are stored on the CD in a direc-tory ‘/Pont’."
Book 1,The files are arranged by chapter: the project discussed here is in thedirectory ‘/Pont/ Ch03_00 – Hello’.
Book 1,"
Rather than using the projects on the CD (where changes cannot be saved),
please copy the files from the CD onto an appropriate directory on your hard disk.Note: you will need to change the file properties after copying: files transferredfrom the CD will be ‘read only’."
Book 1,"When you have copied the files onto your hard disk, please run the Keil
µVision application, and use the ‘Open Project’ option (from the ‘Project’ menu)
to load the ‘Hello’ example."
Book 1,"You will then be able to work with this project by fol-lowing the example described in the remainder of this chapter.36 Embedded C8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 363.3 Configuring the simulator
Having loaded the ‘Hello’ project in the Keil µVision environment, we will begin
by exploring the project settings."
Book 1,"First, using the Project menu, we will look at the 8051 device which we are
intending to use for this application (Figure 3.2).37 Hello, Embedded World
FIGURE 3.2 This is how we choose which particular 8051 chip the hardware will simulate."
Book 1,"In
this project, we are using a ‘generic’ 8052 driver."
Book 1,"This driver will work with all of the examplesin this book
8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 37In this case, we will use a generic ‘8052’ driver: as we discussed in Chapter 2, the
8052 architecture forms the basis of the great majority of current ‘8051’ devices.This driver can be used with all of the examples in this book."
Book 1,The next thing we need to check is the oscillator frequency.
Book 1,"As we also dis-
cussed in Chapter 2, the choice of oscillator frequency has a large impact on8051-based applications."
Book 1,"In most examples in this book, we will assume that theoscillator frequency is 12 MHz. Figure 3.3 shows how to inspect and – if required –alter this frequency.38 Embedded C
FIGURE 3.3 Viewing and – if necessary – changing the oscillator frequency8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 38Note: one of the key reasons for setting the oscillator frequency in the simulator is
that any attempting at ‘profiling’ the application (for example, measuring functiondurations) will only be successful if the oscillator frequency in the simulator matchesthe frequency that will be used in the real system hardware (see Section 3.6e)."
Book 1,"3.4 Building the target
We next need to build the ‘target’, as illustrated in Figure 3.4.
3.5 Running the simulation
Having successfully built the target, we are now ready to start the debug sessionand run the simulator."
Book 1,"First, start a debug session (Figure 3.5).39 Hello, Embedded World

8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 39The ‘flashing LED’ we will view will be connected to Port 1."
Book 1,"We therefore want to
observe the activity on this port (Figure 3.6)."
Book 1,"By default, to speed up the simulation, updates to the various components are
carried out only on demand."
Book 1,"For our purposes, we want to ensure that the simula-tor regularly updates the screen: we do this by ticking the ‘Periodic WindowUpdate’ option in the ‘View’ menu (Figure 3.7)."
Book 1,"Finally, we are ready to start running our ‘Hello, Embedded World’ program in
the simulator (Figure 3.8)."
Book 1,"As the program runs, observe that Pin 1.5 flashes ‘on’ and ‘off’, as required.40 Embedded C
FIGURE 3.5 Starting the simulator (debugger)
Please note: 
The simulator does NOT operate in real time."
Book 1,"What this means is that – except
by chance – the port pin will not flash on for one second, off for one second,when you execute this program."
Book 1,"
To determine the speed at which the code will execute on the real system,
you need to use the ‘Performance Analyzer’ functions provided in the simulator:we discuss these functions in Section 3.6e.8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 4041 Hello, Embedded World

To understand Listing 3.5, recall that – as we discussed in Chapter 2 – Standard 8051s
have four 8-bit ports."
Book 1,"The ports are referred to as Port 0, Port 1, Port 2 and Port 3."
Book 1,"Allports are bidirectional: that is, they may be used for both input and output."
Book 1,"
Control of the ports is carried out using what are known as ‘special function
registers’ (SFRs)."
Book 1,"The SFRs are 8-bit latches: in practical terms, this means that thevalues written to the port are held there until a new value is written or the deviceis reset."
Book 1,"Each of the four ports is represented by an SFR: these are named, appropri-ately, P0, P1, P2 and P3."
Book 1,"Physically, each SFR is an area of memory in the upperareas of internal RAM: P0 is at address 0x80, P1 at address 0x90, P2 at address0xA0 and P3 at address 0xB0."
Book 1,"
Table 3.1 shows the representation of the ports in the SFR area of memory.47 Hello, Embedded World8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 47If we want to write to the ports, we need to write to these addresses."
Book 1,"Assuming
that we are using a C compiler, the process of writing to an address is usuallycarried out by means of a SFR variable declaration,
10hidden in a header file."
Book 1,"
In Listing 3.5, the first #include directive ensures that a copy of the Keil
‘reg52’ file is inserted into the source file before compilation."
Book 1,"Note that this filematches the ‘8052’ register set, and is compatible with the selection of 8052 as thetarget hardware (see Section 3.3)."
Book 1,"The key part of this file as far as this program is concerned is as follows:
..."
Book 1,"/* BYTE Registers */
sfr P0 = 0x80;sfr P1 = 0x90;sfr P2 = 0xA0;sfr P3 = 0xB0;
..."
Book 1,"Having declared the SFR variables, we can write to the ports in a straightforward
manner."
Book 1,"For example, we can send some data to Port 1 as follows:48 Embedded C
10."
Book 1,Reminder.
Book 1,A variable definition consumes memory.
Book 1,"A variables declaration does not consume
memory, it simply associates a name with an area of memory defined elsewhere in the pro-gram."

Please note that, for experienced C programmers, this code may appear to be
incorrect: P1 represents an address , and the correct C syntax would appear to be:

Book 1,"However, because the compiler knows how to deal with SFRs, the use of the indi-
rection operator is not necessary (and code using it will not work as intended)."
Book 1,The example above assumed that we wished to control the whole of Port 1.
Book 1,"In
the ‘Hello, Embedded World’ program, we simply wish to control an individualport pin."
Book 1,"Control of the Pin 1.5 is achieved through the following variable declara-tion in Listing 3.3:
// ------ Port pins -----------------------------------------
sbit LED_pin = P1^5;
The variable type here is sbit : this is not ISO / ANSI C, but is a Keil extension."
Book 1,"Use
of this keyword allows you to declare bit variables which are part of already-defined (byte-sized) variables."
Book 1,Note also the use of the ‘^’ symbol to access aparticular pin: this is again a Keil-specific operation.
Book 1,"Following this declaration, we can control the status of this individual pin by
writing, for example:
LED_pin = 1;
This is exactly what we do later in the program:
// Change the LED from OFF to ON (or vice versa)
if (LED_state_G == 1)
{LED_state_G = 0;LED_pin = 0;}
else
{49 Hello, Embedded World8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 49LED_state_G = 1;
LED_pin = 1;}
d) Creating and using a bit variable
Listing 3.3 also includes the definition of the bitvariable LED_state_G :
// ------ Private variable definitions ----------------------
bit LED_state_G;
As we discussed in Chapter 2, the 8051 device has a BDATA area (16-bytes in size)
in which user-defined bit-sized variables may be stored."
Book 1,(You may like to refer backto Figure 2.6 for details for this).
Book 1,"In this case, we are using the Keil keyword bit to define LED_state_G , a bit-
sized variable that will be stored in the BDATA area."
Book 1,"LED_state_G can (of course)
take on the values of only 1 or 0."
Book 1,"It is used in the program to store the currentstate of the LED (ON or OFF):
if (LED_state_G == 1)
{LED_state_G = 0;LED_pin = 0;}
e) The delay function
The next key component of the ‘Hello, Embedded World’ program is a delay function."
Book 1,"The creation of accurate delays is a key requirement in many embedded appli-
cations."
Book 1,"One way of creating such delays is by using a loop delay, implementedas follows:
void Loop_Delay(void)
{unsigned int x;
for (x=0; x <= 65535; x++);
}
If we find that these delays are not long enough, we can easily extend them by
adding additional layers, as shown in Longer_Loop_Delay() :50 Embedded C8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 50void Longer_Loop_Delay(void)
{unsigned int x;unsigned int y;
for (x=0; x <= 65535; x++)
{for (y=0; y <= 65535; y++);}
}
Listing 3.6 shows how the 1-second delay required in this application is achieved
using this approach."
Book 1,"Listing 3.6 Part of the ‘Hello, Embedded World’ example code
/*------------------------------------------------------------*-
DELAY_LOOP_Wait()Delay duration varies with parameter."
Book 1,"Parameter is, *ROUGHLY*, the delay, in milliseconds,
on 12MHz 8051 (12 osc cycles)."
Book 1,"You need to adjust the timing for your application!
-*------------------------------------------------------------*/
void DELAY_LOOP_Wait(const unsigned int DELAY)
{unsigned int x, y;
for (x = 0; x <= DELAY; x++)
{for (y = 0; y <= 120; y++);}
}
Note: there is nothing miraculous about the values used in this listing: they were
determined by trial and error."
Book 1,"If you use this (or similar) code in a real application,the delays will vary with compiler optimization settings and other factors."
Book 1,"They
must always be checked carefully as par t of the final pre-release tests .1151 Hello, Embedded World
11."
Book 1,"Please note that some more robust techniques for generating delays are considered in Chapter 6.8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 51To check the delay durations, run the Keil simulator as shown earlier."
Book 1,"While the
simulation is running, view the Performance Analyzer (Figure 3.9).52 Embedded C
FIGURE 3.9 Running the Performance Analyzer in order to measure the duration of the loop
delay function
8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 52At this stage, 100% of the processor time is devoted to ‘Unspecified’ activities."
Book 1,"We
now need to indicate that we wish to measure the duration of the loop delay func-tions (Figure 3.10).53 Hello, Embedded World
FIGURE 3.10 (Part 1 of 2) Measuring the duration of the loop delay."
Book 1,"Note that we can profile
multiple functions simultaneously using this approach
8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 53Figure 3.10 (Part 2) reveals that the duration of the loop delay is very close to the
required value."
Book 1,"We can go back and alter the delay code:
void DELAY_LOOP_Wait(const unsigned int DELAY)
{unsigned int x, y;
for (x = 0; x <= DELAY; x++)
{for (y = 0; y <= 1200; y++);}
}
If we then repeat the simulation,
12we can see that the loop delay duration has
increased precisely as expected (Figure 3.11).54 Embedded C

Book 1,"To make this change, you need to: [1] stop the simulation; [2] end the debug session; [3] edit

Book 1,"However, for the benefit of those readers who
– having got this far – would like to run their program on ‘real’ hardware, we pro-vide some suggestions here."
Book 1,"To make your life easier, you should base your design around an 8051 device with

The purpose of this chapter was to show how simple C programs can be developed
and tested using the software tools included with this book."
Book 1,"In the next chapter, we will go on to look at techniques for reading port pins
and working with mechanical switches.56 Embedded C8322 Chapter 3 p35-56  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 564.1 Introduction
In earlier chapters, we have considered some of the fundamental differences
between software development for desktop systems and embedded systems."
Book 1,"We’venoted that embedded systems usually execute one program, which begins runningwhen the device is powered up."
Book 1,We’ve begun to look at a simple software architec-ture – the Super Loop – that is used at the heart of many embedded systems.
Book 1,"Another key challenge for desktop programmers moving into the embedded
market is the implementation of the user interface."
Book 1,"On the desktop, design of theuser interface means working with a high-resolution graphics screen, some form ofmouse (or equivalent ‘pointing’ device), and a large keyboard."
Book 1,Design freedom isrestricted by the fact that the user of your application wants to have a similar ‘lookand feel’ to other applications that he or she uses.
Book 1,"To match these design con-straints – and speed up the development process – developers will typically usesome form of standard code library when building applications, rather thanattempting to create all the code from scratch (Figure 4.1)."
Book 1,"In the embedded world, it may appear – at first sight at least – that there are
fewer constraints."
Book 1,"Instead, it can seem that there is a ‘free for all’ where everydeveloper will implement a different interface to their system."
Book 1,"However, there is atleast one common denominator: embedded systems usually use switches as part oftheir user interface (see Figure 4.2)."
Book 1,"This general rule applies from the most basicremote-control system for opening a garage door, right up to the most sophisti-cated aircraft autopilot system."
Book 1,"Whatever the system you create, you need to beable to create a reliable switch interface."
Book 1,"57chapter4
Reading switches8322 Chapter 4 p57-80  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 57In this chapter, we consider how you can read inputs from mechanical switches in
your embedded application."
Book 1,"Before considering some important characteristics ofthe switches themselves, we will consider the process of reading the state of portpins to which the switches will be connected."
Book 1,"4.2 Basic techniques for reading from port pins
As we saw in Chapter 3, control of the 8051 ports is carried out using 8-bit latches(SFRs)."
Book 1,"We can send some data to Port 1 as follows:
13
sfr P1 = 0x90; // Usually in header fileP1 = 0x0F; // Write 00001111 to Port 158 Embedded C
13."
Book 1,Remember: numbers beginning ‘Ox…’ are in hexadecimal.
Book 1,"‘Hex’ was reviewed in Chapter 2.FIGURE 4.1 Developing the user interface for a modern desktop application will almost
invariably mean working with a high-resolution graphics screen, a keyboard and a mouse, usingcode libraries written in, say, Java or C++Use standard libraries for:
• GUI primitives

• GUI components
(dialog boxes, etc)
• Keyboard• Mouse interface

Up and Around8322 Chapter 4 p57-80  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 58In exactly the same way, we can read from Port 1 as follows:
unsigned char Port_data;
P1 = 0xFF; // Set the port to 'read mode'
Port_data = P1; // Read from the port
After the 8051 microcontroller is reset, the port latches all have the value 0xFF
(11111111 in binary): that is, all the port-pin latches are set to values of ‘1’."
Book 1,"It istempting to assume that writing data to the port is therefore unnecessary, and thatwe can get away with the following version:
unsigned char Port_data;
// Assume nothing written to port since reset 
// – DANGEROUS!!!Port_data = P1;
The problem with this code is that, in simple test programs it works: this can lull
the developer into a false sense of security."
Book 1,"If, at a later date, someone modifies theprogram to include a routine for writing to all or part of the same port, this codewill not generally work as required:
unsigned char Port_data;
P1 = 0x00;...// Assumes nothing written to port since reset
// – WON’T WORKPort_data = P1;
In most cases, initialization functions are used to set the port pins to a known
state at the start of the program."
Book 1,"Where this is not possible, it is safer to alwayswrite ‘1’ to any port pin before reading from it.59 Reading switches
Note: because of the underlying hardware, we can only read from a pin if the
corresponding latch contains a ‘1’ ."
Book 1,"In practice, this means that – in order to read
from a pin – we need to ensure that the last thing written to the pin was a ‘1’."
Book 1,"8322 Chapter 4 p57-80  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 594.3 Example: Reading and writing bytes
Listing 4.1 is a simple example which illustrates how we can read from one port
on an 8051 microcontroller and ‘echo’ the result on another port."

4.4 Example: Reading and writing bits (simple version)
Listing 4.1 demonstrated how to read from or write to an entire port."
Book 1,"However, sup-
pose we have a switch connected to Pin 1.0 and an LED connected to Pin 1.1. Wemight also have input and output devices connected to the other pins on Port 1.These pins may be used by totally different parts of the same system, and the codeto access them may be produced by other team members, or other companies."
Book 1,It istherefore essential that we are able to read-from or write-to individual port pinswithout altering the values of other pins on the same port.
Book 1,"We provided a simple example in which we controlled an individual pin in Chapter
3."
Book 1,"Listing 4.2 goes one step further and illustrates how we can read from Pin 1.0, andwrite to Pin 1.1, without disrupting any other pins on this (or any other) port."

4.6 The need for pull-up resistors
In our discussions in this chapter, we have assumed that we were reading from portpins in the simulator: we have not yet considered how a switch will actually be con-nected to the 8051 port pin in a real application."
Book 1,Figure 4.4 illustrates one possibility.
Book 1,"This hardware operates as follows:
GWhen the switch is open, it has no impact on the port pin."
Book 1,An internal resistoron the port ‘pulls up’ the pin to the supply voltage of the microcontroller (typi-cally 5V).
Book 1,"If we read the pin, we will see the value ‘1’."
Book 1,"(We say more aboutpull-up resistors below).67 Reading switches8322 Chapter 4 p57-80  21/2/02  9:55 am  Page 67GWhen the switch is closed (pressed), the pin voltage will be 0V."
Book 1,"If we read the
the pin, we will see the value ‘0’."
Book 1,"The internal ‘pull up’ resistors referred to above can be thought of as small springs,
connecting the port pin to a ‘1’ value."
Book 1,"To change the port setting, we need to‘push’ the pin down to 0, against the force of the spring (Figure 4.5)."
Book 1,"Where there is no pull-up resistor, changing the state of the input pin is not possi-
ble: not matter how hard we push, the pin will always read ‘0’ (Figure 4.6).68 Embedded C

only applies to Port 1, Port 2 and Port 3, since these ports all have internal pull-upresistors."
Book 1,"This arrangement does not apply to Port 0, which has no internal pull-ups."
Book 1,"If you need to connect a switch (or similar device) to Port 0, you can do so,but you need to add an external pull-up resistor: a resistance of 10 K Ωis appropri-
ate here (see Figure 4.7)."
Book 1,"4.7 Dealing with switch bounce
In an ideal world, this change in voltage obtained by connecting a switch to the
port pin of an 8051 microcontroller would take the form illustrated in Figure 4.8(top)."
Book 1,"In practice, all mechanical switch contacts bounce (that is, turn on and off,
repeatedly, for a short period of time) after the switch is closed or opened."
Book 1,"As aresult, the actual input waveform looks more like that shown in Figure 4.8(bottom)."
Book 1,"Usually, switches bounce for less than 20 ms: however large mechanicalswitches exhibit bounce behaviour for 50 ms or more."
Book 1,"When you turn on the lights in your home or office with a mechanical switch,
the switches will bounce."
Book 1,"As far as humans are concerned, this bounce is imper-ceptible."
Book 1,"However, as far as the microcontroller is concerned, each ‘bounce’ isequivalent to one press and release of an ‘ideal’ switch."
Book 1,"Without appropriate soft-ware design, this can give rise to a number of problems, not least:
GRather than reading ‘A’ from a keypad, we may read ‘AAAAA’."
Book 1,GCounting the number of times that a switch is pressed becomes extremely difficult.
Book 1,"GIf a switch is depressed once, and then released some time later, the ‘bounce’ maymake it appear as if the switch has been pressed again (at the time of release).69 Reading switches

straightforward:
1We read the relevant port pin."
Book 1,"2If we think we have detected a switch depression, we wait for 20 ms and then
read the pin again."
Book 1,"3If the second reading confirms the first reading, we assume the switch really has
been depressed."
Book 1,"Note that the figure of ‘20 ms’ will, of course, depend on the switch used: the data
sheet of the switch will provide this information."
Book 1,"If you have no data sheet, you caneither experiment with different figures, or measure directly using an oscilloscope."
Book 1,"4.8 Example: Reading switch inputs (basic code)
In this example, we present a simple code library for reading the input from amechanical switch."
Book 1,"The code implements – directly – the algorithm described inSection 4.7: that is, it tests the switch state and – if the switch is pressed – executesa ‘debounce delay’ before testing the switch again.70 Embedded C

Book 1,"4.9 Example: Counting goats
Variations of the simple switch-reading code presented in Listing 4.5 are cur-
rently in use in many embedded systems."
Book 1,"However, this code is not suitable forall purposes."
Book 1,"
With this simple code, problems can arise whenever a switch is pressed for a
period longer than the debounce interval."
Book 1,"This is a concern, because in manycases, users will press switches for at least 500 ms (or until they receive feedbackthat the system has detected the switch press)."
Book 1,"As a result, a user typing ‘Hello’ ona keypad may see ‘HHHHHHHHHeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllooooooooooo’ appearon the screen."
Book 1,"One consequence is that this code is not suitable for applications where we
need to count the number of times that a switch is pressed and then released.For example, suppose we wish to use this code to count the number of goatspassing into a milking parlour (Figure 4.10)."
Book 1,"We assume that the optical sensorarrangement gives a ‘Logic 0’ output while a goat is passing and a ‘Logic 1’output at other times (Figure 4.11).75 Reading switches

leading result."
Book 1,"For example, suppose that the debounce period is 20 ms."
Book 1,"If a goattakes – say – around five seconds to pass the sensor, then the SWITCH_Get_Input()
function will count a total of around 250 goats every time one goat passes (250 =5000 ms / 20 ms): in other words, the goat sensor will not allow us to count
the number of goats but will instead provide an indication of the time taken
for the goats to pass the sensor ."
Book 1,"
A simple way to solve such problems is to wait until a switch is released
before returning from a switch-test function."
Book 1,"This approach is illustrated in thefunction SWITCH_Get_Input() in Listing 4.6. The code in this listing is used
to do two things:

Book 1,"4.10 Conclusions
The switch interface code presented and discussed in this chapter has allowed us
to do two things:
GTo perform an activity while a switch is depressed."
Book 1,GTo respond to the fact that a user has pressed – and then released – a switch.
Book 1,"In both cases, we have illustrated how the switch may be ‘debounced’ in software."
Book 1,"In Chapter 5, we turn our attention to techniques that can help you re-use the
code you develop in subsequent projects.80 Embedded C
FIGURE 4.12 Counting the number of goats using the hardware simulator."

In addition to the key technical issues we have examined in previous chapters
(such as the use of a Super Loop, or the design and implementation of an appro-priate switch interface), there are other factors which need to be considered bydesktop developers migrating to the desktop area."
Book 1,"For example, we made the fol-lowing observations in Chapter 1:
GNo software company remains in business for very long if it generates new code,from scratch, for every project."
Book 1,"The language used must support the creation offlexible libraries, making it easy to re-use (well-tested) code components in a rangeof projects."
Book 1,It must also be possible to adapt complete code systems to work with anew or updated processor with minimal difficulty.
Book 1,GStaff members change and existing personnel have limited memory spans.
Book 1,"Atthe same time, systems evolve and processors are updated."
Book 1,"As concern over the‘Year 2000’ problem in recent years has illustrated, many embedded systemshave a long lifespan."
Book 1,"During this time, their code will often have to be main-tained."
Book 1,"Good code must therefore be easy to understand now, and in five years’time (and not just by those who first wrote it)."
Book 1,"
To support these activities, we will do three things in this chapter:
1We will describe how to use an object-oriented style of programming with C
programs, allowing the creation of libraries of code that can be easily adaptedfor use in different embedded projects."
Book 1,"81chapter5
Adding structure to your code8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 812We will describe how to create and use a ‘Project Header’ file."
Book 1,"This file encapsu-
lates key aspects of the hardware environment, such as the type of processor to beused, the oscillator frequency and the number of oscillator cycles required to exe-cute each instruction."
Book 1,"This helps to document the system, and makes it easier toport the code to a different processor."
Book 1,3We will describe how to create and use a ‘Port Header’ file.
Book 1,"This brings together
all details of the port access from the whole system."
Book 1,"Like the Project Header,this helps during porting and also serves as a means of documenting importantsystem features."
Book 1,"We will use all three of these techniques in the code examples presented in subse-
quent chapters."
Book 1,"
We begin by discussing how to use object-oriented styles of programming with
the C language."
Book 1,"5.2 Object-oriented programming with C
One way in which the different programming languages may be classified is as aseries of generations (see Table 5.1)."
Book 1,"It is often argued that object-oriented (O-O) design – and O-O programming lan-
guages – have advantages when compared with those from earlier generations."
Book 1,"Forexample, as Graham notes:
15
[The phrase] ‘object-oriented’ has become almost synonymous with modernity, good-ness and worth in information technology circles.82 Embedded C
TABLE 5.1 The classification of programming languages into different generations."
Book 1,"Please note
that some people consider O-O languages to be 5GLs: however, this distinction will not have
an impact on our discussions here
Language generation Example languages
– Machine Code
First-Generation Language (1GL) Assembly Language."
Book 1,"Second-Generation Languages (2GLs) COBOL, FORTRAN
Third-Generation Languages (3GLs) C, Pascal, Ada 83
Fourth-Generation Languages (4GLs) C++, Java, Ada 95
15."
Book 1,"Graham, I."
Book 1,"(1994) Object-Oriented Methods , (2nd edn) Addison-Wesley, Harlow, England, p."
Book 1,"1.8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 82A frequent argument is that the O-O approach is more effective than those previ-
ously used because it represents ‘a more natural way’ of thinking about problems.As Jalote notes:
16
One main claimed advantage of using object orientation is that an OO model closely rep-resents the problem domain, which makes it easier to produce and understand designs."
Book 1,"You might reasonably ask why this book uses C, rather than a language from a
later generation (such as C++ or Java)."
Book 1,"The reason is that O-O languages are notreadily available for small embedded systems, primarily because of the overheadsinherent in the O-O approach."
Book 1,"
It is easy to see the source of these overheads."
Book 1,"Suppose, for example, we have a
C program with a variable Xyzthat we wish to set to some value and then display."
Book 1,"We might do so using the following code:
..."
Book 1,"int Xyz;
Xyz = 3;...printf(""%d"", Xyz);
Now, consider the following O-O version, using C++:
class cClass
{public:
int  Get_Xyz(void) const; void Set_Xyz(const int); 
private:
int _Xyz; // Encapsulated data
}; 
..."
Book 1,"cClass abc;
abc.Set_Xyz(3);...cout << abc.Get_Xyz();83 Adding structure to your code

New York.8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 83The C++ version has both strengths and weaknesses:
☺In the C++ code, the data ( _Xyz ) are encapsulated in the class: access to these
data is controlled because it is possible only via the two member functions.By contrast, the data ( Xyz) in the C version are ‘global’ variables and can be
altered anywhere in the program."
Book 1,"From a design perspective, the C++ code ismore elegant."
Book 1,It may also prove easier to maintain.
Book 1,"/frownfaceThere is a CPU time overhead associated with the C++ code: this is, at least, the
cost of two (member) function calls."
Book 1,"In real applications, such overheads can besubstantial: even Stroustrup, creator of the C++ programming language, hasacknowledged that a C++ implementation is likely to run 25% more slowly thanan equivalent application in FORTRAN."
Book 1,"17This can have implications for embed-
ded projects where speed of processing is a primary concern."
Book 1,"For example,Sommerville cites the case of an aircraft system in which an O-O solution wasabandoned due to the impact of these overheads."
Book 1,"18
One solution to such performance problems is to ‘in line’ the member functions:this can greatly reduce the CPU overhead, but a penalty will then be paid in termsof memory usage."
Book 1,"19
Neither the CPU performance load nor the alternative memory load present a sig-nificant problem on multi-megabyte desktop PCs, but – on the type of embeddedprojects considered in this book (where teams may struggle with code to save oneor two bytes of memory) a ‘pure’ O-O approach is rarely practical."
Book 1,"Does this mean that O-O design principles need (or should) be avoided by C pro-
grammers?"
Book 1,Fortunately it does not.
Book 1,"For many years before O-O techniques enteredthe mainstream, C programmers used a ‘modular’ style of programming which iswell supported by the language."
Book 1,"Using this approach, it is possible to create ‘file-based-classes’ in C without imposing a significant memory or CPU load:
// BEGIN: File XYZ.C
static int Xyz;Xyz = 3;...printf(""%d"", Xyz);// END: File XYZ.C84 Embedded C

Book 1,"a) The device header
The first entry in the project header is the link to the appropriate ‘device header’ file."
Book 1,"
We discussed one such file (‘reg52.h’) in Chapter 3."
Book 1,"These files will, in most
cases, have been produced by your compiler manufacturer, and will include theaddresses of the special function registers (SFRs) used for port access, plus similardetails for other on-chip components such as analog-to-digital converters."
Book 1,"For example, Listing 5.4 shows part of the device header for an Extended 8051,
the Infineon C515C."
Book 1,"This device has eight ports, a watchdog unit, analog-to-digitalconverter and other components, all made accessible through the device header."

b) Oscillator frequency and oscillations per instruction
If you create an application using a particular 8051 device operating at a particularoscillator frequency, with a particular number of oscillations per instruction, thisinformation will be required when compiling many of the different source files in91 Adding structure to your code8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 91your project."
Book 1,"For example – in many cases – we can create code for generating
delays (and similar purposes) if we store information about the oscillator fre-quency and number of oscillations-per-instruction in an appropriate form."
Book 1,"This isdone in the Main.H file as follows:
// Oscillator / resonator frequency (in Hz) e.g. (11059200UL)
#define OSC_FREQ (12000000UL)
// Number of oscillations per instruction (12, etc)
// 12 – Original 8051 / 8052 and numerous modern versions// 6 – Various Infineon and Philips devices, etc.// 4 – Dallas 320, 520 etc.// 1 – Dallas 420, etc."
Book 1,"#define OSC_PER_INST (12)
We will demonstrate how to use this information in Chapter 6 (for creating
delays), Chapter 7 (for controlling timing in an operating system) and Chapter 9(for controlling the baud rate in a serial interface)."
Book 1,"c) Common data types
The next part of the Project Header file in Listing 5.3 includes three typedef
statements:
typedef unsigned char tByte;typedef unsigned int tWord;typedef unsigned long tLong;
In C, the typedef keyword allows us to provide aliases for data types: we can then
use these aliases in place of the original types."
Book 1,"Thus, in the projects you will seecode like this:
tWord Temperature;
Rather than:
unsigned int Temperature;
The main reason for using these typedef statements is to simplify – and promote
– the use of unsigned data types."
Book 1,"This is a good idea for two main reasons:92 Embedded C8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 92GThe 8051 does not support signed arithmetic and extra code is required to
manipulate signed data: this reduces your program speed and increases the pro-gram size."
Book 1,"Wherever possible, it makes sense to use unsigned data, and thesetypedef statements make this easier."
Book 1,"
GUse of bitwise operators (see Chapter 4) generally makes sense only with
unsigned data types: use of ‘ typedef ’ variables reduces the likelihood that pro-
grammers will inadvertently apply these operators to signed data."
Book 1,"Finally, as in desktop programming, use of the typedef keyword in this way can
make it easier to adapt your code for use on a different processor (for example,when you move your 8051 code to a 32-bit environment)."
Book 1,"In many circumstances,you will simply be able to change the typedef statements in Main.H , rather than
editing every source file in your project."
Book 1,"d) Interrupts
As we noted in Chapter 2, interrupts are a key component of most embedded systems."
Book 1,"
The following lines in the Project Header are intended to make it easier for you
to use (timer-based) interrupts in your projects:
#define INTERRUPT_Timer_0_Overflow 1
#define INTERRUPT_Timer_1_Overflow 3#define INTERRUPT_Timer_2_Overflow 5
We discuss how to make use of this facility in Chapter 7."
Book 1,e) Summary: Use of a Project Header?
Book 1,"Use of Project Header can help to make your code more readable, not least because
anyone using your projects knows where to find key information, such as the modelof microcontroller and the oscillator frequency required to execute the software."
Book 1,"
The use of a Project Header can help to make your code more easily portable, by
placing some of the key microcontroller-dependent data in one place: if youchange the processor or the oscillator used then – in many cases – you will need tomake changes only to the Project Header."
Book 1,Almost every example project on the CD includes a Project Header file.
Book 1,"Search
for the file Main.H on the CD to see further examples.93 Adding structure to your code8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 935.4 The Port Header ( Port.H )
In a typical embedded project, you may have a user interface created using an
LCD, a keypad, and one or more single LEDs. There may be a serial (RS-485) linkto another microcontroller board."
Book 1,There may be one or more high-power devices(say 3-phase industrial motors) to be controlled.
Book 1,"
Each of these (software) components in your application will require exclusive
access to one or more port pins."
Book 1,"Following the structure discussed in Section 5.2,the project may include 10–20 different source files, created – perhaps – by fivedifferent people."
Book 1,How do you ensure that changes to port access in one compo-nent does not impact on another?
Book 1,How do you ensure that it is easy to adapt theapplication to an environment where different port pins must be used?
Book 1,These issues are addressed through the use of a simple Port Header file (Figure 5.3).
Book 1,"Using a Port Header, you pull together the different port access features for the wholeproject into a single (header) file."
Book 1,"Use of this technique can ease project develop-ment, maintenance and porting."
Book 1,The Port Header file is simple to understand and easy to apply.
Book 1,"Consider, for exam-
ple, that we have three C files in a project (A, B, C), each of which require access toone or more port pins, or to a complete port."
Book 1,"
File A may include the following:
// File A
sbit Pin_A = P3^2;...94 Embedded C
FIGURE 5.3 A schematic representation of the port header filePort Header (Port.H)
// Switches
sbit Sw_up = P1ˆ2;sbit Sw_down = P1ˆ3;// Pins 3.0 and 3.1 used
// for RS-232 interface
Down Up8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 94File B may include the following:
// File B
#define Port_B P0..."
Book 1,"File C may include the following:
// File C
sbit Pin_C = P2^7;..."
Book 1,"In this version of the code, all of the port access requirements are spread over mul-
tiple files."
Book 1,"Instead of this, there are many advantages obtained by integrating allport access in a single Port.H header file:
// ----- Port.H -----
// Port access for File B
#define Port_B P0
// Port access for File A
sbit Pin_A = P3^2;
// Port access for File C
sbit Pin_C = P2^7;
…
Each of the remaining project files will then ‘ #include ’ the file ‘Port.H ’."
Book 1,Listing 5.5 shows a complete example of a Port.H file from a real application.

Despite its simplicity, use of a Port Header file can improve reliability and safety,
because it avoids potential conflicts between port pins, particularly during themaintenance phase of the project when developers (who may not have beeninvolved in the original design) are required to make code changes."
Book 1,"A Port Header is itself portable: it can be used with any microcontroller, and is not
linked to the 8051 family."
Book 1,"Use of a Port Header also improves portability, by makingaccessible, in one location, all of the port access requirements of the application."

Book 1,"5.8 Conclusions
Over the course of the first five chapters of this book, we have reached the stage wherewe can create a simple – but functional – code framework for an embedded application."
Book 1,"
In the remainder of this book, much of what we do will involve examining and
refining different parts of this framework until – by the time we reach the casestudy in Chapter 11 – we will be in a position to assemble a range of completeembedded projects.111 Adding structure to your code8322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 11118322 Chapter 5 p81-112  21/2/02  9:57 am  Page 1126.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we begin to consider the issues involved in the accurate measure-
ment of time."
Book 1,These issues are important because many embedded systems mustsatisfy real-time constraints.
Book 1,"For example, consider the aircraft autopilot application illustrated in Figure 6.1.
Here we assume that the pilot has entered the required course heading, and thatthe system must make regular and frequent changes to the rudder, elevator,aileron and engine settings (for example) in order to keep the aircraft followingthis path."

An important characteristic of this embedded system is the need to process
inputs and generate outputs very rapidly, on a time-scale measured in millisec-onds."
Book 1,"In this case, even a slight delay in making changes to the rudder setting (forexample) may cause the plane to oscillate very unpleasantly or, in extreme circum-stances, even to crash."
Book 1,"However, in order to be able to have such an autopilotsystem certified for use, ensuring that the processing was ‘as fast as we could makeit’ would not be enough to satisfy the relevant authorities: in this situation, as inmany other real-time applications, the key characteristic is deterministic process-
ing."
Book 1,"What this means is that in many real-time embedded systems we need to beable to guarantee that a particular activity will always be completed within (say) 2
ms: if the processing does not match this specification, then the application is notsimply slower than we would like, it is useless."

requirements of many embedded applications."
Book 1,"For example, in Chapter 4, we pre-sented an example in which we counted goats moving into a milking parlour."
Book 1,"Atthe heart of this system was the function shown in annotated form in Listing 6.1.
Listing 6.1 Identifying problems with some simple switch-interface code
bit SWITCH_Get_Input(const tByte DEBOUNCE_PERIOD)
{tByte Return_value = SWITCH_NOT_PRESSED;
if (Switch_pin == 0)
{// Switch is pressed
// Debounce – just wait..."
Book 1,"DELAY_LOOP_Wait(DEBOUNCE_PERIOD); // POTENTIAL PROBLEM
// Check switch again
if (Switch_pin == 0)
{// Wait until the switch is released.while (Switch_pin == 0);     // POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE
Return_value = SWITCH_PRESSED;
}
}
// Now (finally) return switch value
return Return_value;}
Listing 6.1 highlights two potential problems with function SWITCH_Get_Input() .21
The first problem is that we wait for a ‘debounce’ period in order to confirm
that the switch has been pressed:
DELAY_LOOP_Wait(DEBOUNCE_PERIOD); 
Because this delay is implemented using a software loop it may not be very pre-
cisely timed."
Book 1,"We illustrate how we can set this delay period more accurately usinga hardware timer in Section 6.2.115 Meeting real-time constraints
21."
Book 1,"There  are, in fact, three problems."
Book 1,"The third problem is that – while waiting for the switch to be 
released and (to a lesser extent) while executing the ‘debounce delay’ – we are wasting processor cycles that could be put to better use."
Book 1,"We need to defer consideration of this third problem until Chapter 7, when we will demonstrate that it may be solved using an embedded operating system.8322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 115The second problem is even more serious in a system with real-time characteris-
tics."
Book 1,"With this code:
while (Switch_pin == 0);
we cause the system to wait – indefinitely – for the user to release the switch."
Book 1,"This
means that a damaged switch connection – or a determined user – can bring thesystem to a halt."
Book 1,"Such code is simply unacceptable in production code (and cer-tainly would not achieve certification, in the case of the autopilot system)."
Book 1,"We willbegin to consider how we can solve this second problem in Section 6.6.
6.2 Creating ‘hardware delays’ using Timer 0 and Timer 1
We have used simple loop delays (similar to that shown below) in earlier chapters:
void DELAY_LOOP_Wait(const unsigned int DELAY)
{unsigned int x, y;
for (x = 0; x <= DELAY; x++)
{for (y = 0; y <= 120; y++);}
}
This approach to generating delays is easy to understand and easy to use (on any
embedded or desktop processor)."
Book 1,"However, it is not easy to produce preciselytimed delays using this approach, and the loops must be re-tuned if you decide touse a different processor, change the clock frequency, or even change the compileroptimization settings."
Book 1,"If we want to create more accurate delays, then we can do so using one of the
8051’s on-chip timers."
Book 1,"As we noted in Chapter 2, all members of the 8051 familyhave at least two 16-bit timer / counters, known as Timer 0 and Timer 1."
Book 1,Thesetimers can be used to generate accurate delays.
Book 1,"
To see how these timers operate, we need to explain the features of:
GThe TCON SFR;
GThe TMOD SFR; and,
GThe THx and TLx registers."
Book 1,"We will first consider – in outline – how hardware timers are used to generate
accurate delays, then consider each of the above timer components in more detail.116 Embedded C8322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 116a) Overview
We noted in Chapter 2 that – when the timer hardware is running and appropri-
ately configured – the timers are incremented periodically."
Book 1,"In the original 8051and 8052, the timers were incremented every 12 oscillator cycles:
22assuming we
used a 12 MHz oscillator, the timers were incremented 1 million times per second."
Book 1,"
In most cases, we will be concerned with 16-bit timers."
Book 1,"Assuming the count
starts at 0, then – after 65.535 ms – our 12 MHz 8051 will reach its maximumvalue (65535) and the timer will then ‘overflow’."
Book 1,"When it overflows, a hardwareflag will be set."
Book 1,We can easily read this flag in software.
Book 1,This is very useful behaviour.
Book 1,"For example, if we start the timer with an initial value
of zero and wait until the flag is set, we know that precisely 65.535 ms will haveelapsed."
Book 1,"More importantly, we can vary the initial value stored in the timer: this allowsus to generate shorter, precisely-timed, delays of – say – 50ms or 1ms, as required."
Book 1,"Building on the material discussed above, calculations of hardware delays
generally take the following form:
GWe calculate the required starting value for the timer."
Book 1,GWe load this value into the timer.
Book 1,GWe start the timer.
Book 1,"GThe timer will be incremented, without software intervention, at a rate deter-mined by the oscillator frequency; we wait for the timer to reach its maximumvalue and ‘roll over’."
Book 1,GThe timer signals the end of the delay by changing the value of a flag variable.
Book 1,"As noted above, if we are using a ‘12-oscillations per instruction’ 8051, running at
12 MHz, the longest delay that can be produced with a 16-bit timer is approxi-mately 65 ms."
Book 1,"If we need longer delays, we can repeat the steps above."
Book 1,We will now consider how we can write code to achieve this.
Book 1,"b) The TCON SFR
We first need to introduce the TCON special function register (SFR): see Table 6.1.
The various bits in the TCON SFR have the following functions:117 Meeting real-time constraints
22."
Book 1,"We consider some more modern 8051 devices in Section 6.4: these require fewer than 12
oscillator cycles per timer increment.TABLE 6.1 The TCON Special Function Register."
Book 1,"Note that the grey bits are not connected with either Timer
0 or Timer 1
Bit 7 (MSB) 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 (LSB)
NAME TF1 TR1 TF0 TR0 IE1 IT1 IE0 IT08322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 117TR0, TR1 Timer run control bits
These bits need to be set to 1 (by the programmer) to run the corresponding timer (TR0
controls Timer 0, TR1 controls Timer 1)."
Book 1,"If set to 0, the corresponding timer will not run.Default value (after reset) is 0."
Book 1,"TF0, TF1 Timer overflow flags
These bits are set to 1 (by the microcontroller) when the corresponding timer overflows."
Book 1,"They
need to be manually cleared (set to 0) by the programmer."
Book 1,Default value (after reset) is 0.
Book 1,"For completeness we will briefly explain the purpose of the remaining bits in TCON:
IE0, IE1 Interrupt flags
Set by hardware when an (external) interrupt is detected on Pin 12 or Pin 13, respectively."
Book 1,These features are not related to Timer 0 or Timer 1 and are not used in this book (these bitscan be left at their default value).
Book 1,"IT0, IT1 Interrupt type control bit
Used to determine with the external interrupt flags (above) are set in response to a falling
edge (‘edge triggered’) or a low-level (‘level triggered’) input on the relevant port pins.These features are not related to Timer 0 or Timer 1 and are not used in this book (these bitscan be left at their default value)."
Book 1,c) What about interrupts?
Book 1,"The code we use to create delays in this chapter will take the following form:
while (TF0 == 0); // Wait until Timer 0 overflows
That is, we wait until the timer overflow flag indicates that the timer has reached
its maximum value."
Book 1,It should be pointed out that the overflow of the timers canbe used to generate an interrupt: this can allow you to perform other activitieswhile the counting goes on.
Book 1,"We will not make use of this facility in the delay codepresented in this chapter, but we will do so when we create an embedded operat-ing system in Chapter 7."
Book 1,"To disable the generation of interrupts, we can use the C statements:
ET0 = 0; // No interupts (Timer 0)
ET1 = 0; // No interupts (Timer 1)118 Embedded C8322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 118d) The TMOD SFR
We also need to introduce the TMOD SFR (Table 6.2)."
Book 1,"The main thing to note is that there are three modes of operation (for each timer), set
using the M1 and M0 bits."
Book 1,"We will only be concerned in this book with Mode 1 andMode 2, which operate in the same way for both Timer 0 and Timer 1, as follows:
Mode 1 (M1 = 1; M2 = 0)
16-bit timer/counter (with manual reload)23
Mode 2 (M1 = 0; M2 = 1)8-bit timer/counter (with 8-bit automatic reload)
The remaining bits in TMOD have the following purpose:
GATE Gating controlWe will not use gating control in this book."
Book 1,"We will ensure that this bit is cleared, which
means that Timer 0 or Timer 1 will be enabled whenever the corresponding control bit (TR0or TR1) is set in the TCON SFR."
Book 1,"C / T–Counter or timer select bit
We will not use counter mode in this book."
Book 1,"We will ensure that this bit is cleared (for the
appropriate timer), so that timer mode is used."
Book 1,"e) The THx and TLx registers
The final components you need to be aware of are the two 8-bit registers associ-
ated with each timer: these are known as TL0 and TH0, and TL1 and TH1."
Book 1,"Here, ‘L’and ‘H’ refer to ‘low’ and ‘high’ bytes, as will become clear shortly.119 Meeting real-time constraints

23."
Book 1,"The distinction between ‘automatic reload’ and ‘manual reload’ timers has no impact on the
hardware delay code we use here: to avoid confusion, we delay a discussion of this topic untilSection 7.2b.8322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 119In all of the delay examples we use in this book, we will use the timers in Mode 1:
that is, as 16-bit timers."
Book 1,"If we are using Timer 1 to generate the delays, then thevalues loaded into TL1 and TH1 at the start of the delay routine will determine thedelay duration."
Book 1,"For example, suppose we wish to generate a 15 ms hardware delay."
Book 1,"We will
assume that we are using a 12 MHz 8051, and that this device requires 12 oscilla-tor cycles to perform each timer increment: the timer is incremented at a 1 MHzrate."
Book 1,"A 15 ms delay therefore requires the following number of timer increments:
15ms---------------- ×1000000 = 15000 increments."
Book 1,"1000 ms
The timer overflows when it is incremented from its maximum count of 65535."
Book 1,"Thus, the initial value we need to load to produce a 15ms delay is:
65536 – 15000 = 50536 (decimal) = 0xC568
We can load this initial value into Timer 1 as follows:
TH1 = 0xC5;    // Timer 1 initial value (High Byte)
TL1 = 0x68;    // Timer 1 initial value (Low Byte)
We give another illustration of this process in the next section."
Book 1,"6.3 Example: Generating a precise 50 ms delay
To see how this all fits together, we will consider a ‘flashing LED’ example based
on a precise 50 ms hardware delay (Listing 6.2)."

Book 1,"As we discussed in Section 6.2c the overflow of a timer can be used to generate
an interrupt: we have no need for this in the delay code presented here."
Book 1,"We there-fore disable interrupt generation as follows:
ET0 = 0; // No interupts

GIf your application is battery powered, you will generally wish to use as low an
operating frequency as possible (refer back to Chapter 2, Section 2.5b, for fur-ther details)."
Book 1,"To do this, you will typically work with late prototypes of yoursystem (first in the simulator and then on hardware) to ‘profile’ the code anddetermine the minimum safe operating frequency."

GIf you add a serial interface then – for reasons we will discuss in Chapter 9 – youare likely to use an 11.059 MHz crystal."
Book 1,"If you assumed a 12 MHz oscillator andforget to adjust delay timing, then the differences can be difficult to detect inbench tests, and any problems may only show up after your product has beenreleased."

To reduce the likelihood of such problems, the code presented in this example is
designed to be as portable as possible."

Book 1,"In many cases, as we saw in Chapter 2, modern ‘8051’ family devices are based on
the slightly later 8052 architecture: such devices include an extra, more flexibletimer: this is called – logically – Timer 2."
Book 1,"
Timer 2 can be used to generate delays (in a manner nearly identical to that
used with Timer 0 and Timer 1 in this chapter)."
Book 1,"However, this is not an inappro-priate use for this resource (in most applications)."
Book 1,"This is because Timer 2 hasfeatures which make it particularly well suited to the creation of an operatingsystem, and most ‘real’ applications will reserve Timer 2 for this purpose."

We will describe an operating system based on Timer 2 in Chapter 7."
Book 1,"6.6 The need for ‘timeout’ mechanisms

As we noted above, the problem is that the system will ‘hang’ if the switch is never
released."

through the gate."
Book 1,"However, with the first simple implementation of this system,100% of the processor power is wasted in an idle loop, waiting for the switch to bereleased."
Book 1,This is clearly not an ideal design.
Book 1,"Such problems are not, of course, limited to switch interfaces."
Book 1,"For example, the
Philips 8Xc552 is an Extended 8051 device with a number of on-chip peripherals,including an 8-channel, 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)."
Book 1,Philips providean application note (AN93017) that describes how to use this feature of the micro-controller.
Book 1,"This application note includes the following code:
// Wait until AD conversion finishes (checking ADCI)
while ((ADCON & ADCI) == 0); 
Such code is potentially unreliable, because there are circumstances under which our
application may ‘hang’."
Book 1,"This might occur for one or more of the following reasons:
GIf the ADC has been incorrectly initialized, we cannot be sure that a data con-version will be carried out."
Book 1,"GIf the ADC has been subjected to an excessive input voltage, then it may notoperate at all."
Book 1,"GIf the variable ADCON or ADCI were not correctly initialized, they may notoperate as required."
Book 1,The Philips example is not intended to illustrate ‘production’ code.
Book 1,"Unfortunately,
however, code in this form is common in embedded applications."
Book 1,"If the systemsyou create are to be reliable, you need to be able to guarantee that no function willhang in this way."
Book 1,"
There are several ways we can provide such a guarantee."
Book 1,"We will consider two of
the most popular in the sections that follow:
GThe loop timeout (see Section 6.7)."
Book 1,GThe hardware timeout (see Section 6.10).
Book 1,"6.7 Creating loop timeouts
A loop timeout may be easily created."
Book 1,"The basis of the code structure is a form ofloop delay, created as follows:130 Embedded C8322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 130tWord Timeout_loop = 0;
…
while (++Timeout_loop != 0);
This loop will keep running until the variable Timeout_loop reaches its maxi-
mum value (assuming 16-bit integers) of 65535, and then overflows."
Book 1,"When thishappens, the program will continue."
Book 1,"Note that, without some simulation studiesor prototyping, we cannot easily determine how long this delay will be."
Book 1,"However,we do know that the loop will, eventually, time out."
Book 1,"Such a loop is simply a slightly modified version of the loop-delay code which
we have presented previously."
Book 1,"However, if we consider again the ADC example dis-cussed in the previous section, we can illustrate how such a loop can be used toprovide a timeout facility."
Book 1,"Recall that the original code was as follows:
// Wait until AD conversion finishes (checking ADCI)
while ((ADCON & ADCI) == 0); 
Here is a modified version of this code, with a loop timeout:tWord Timeout_loop = 0;
// Take sample from ADC
// Wait until conversion finishes (checking ADCI)// – simple loop timeoutwhile (((ADCON & ADCI) == 0) && (++Timeout_loop != 0));
Note that we can vary the duration of the loop timeout by changing the initial
value assigned to the loop variable."

6.10 Creating hardware timeouts
If we consider the ability to meet real-time requirements by code without timeoutsand code with a loop timeout, it is clear that the loop timeout solution is signifi-cantly better."
Book 1,"
Loop timeouts are particularly well suited to applications involving long time-
out delays (typically measured in seconds)."
Book 1,"Where we require shorter delays, withvery precise timing, we can often gain a further improvement in performancethrough the use of hardware-based timeouts."
Book 1,"As we saw in earlier in this chapter, we can create portable and easy to use delay
code for the 8051 family as follows:136 Embedded C8322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 136// Define Timer 0 / Timer 1 preload values for ~1 msec delay
#define PRELOAD_01ms (65536-(tWord)(OSC_FREQ/(OSC_PER_INST*1000)))
#define PRELOAD_01ms_H (PRELOAD_01ms / 256)
#define PRELOAD_01ms_L (PRELOAD_01ms % 256)//
...void Hardware_Delay_T0(const tLong MS)   
{tLong ms;
// Configure Timer 0 as a 16-bit timer 
TMOD &= 0xF0; // Clear all T0 bits (T1 left unchanged)TMOD |= 0x01; // Set required T0 bits (T1 left unchanged) 
ET0 = 0;  // No interrupts// Delay value is *approximately* 1 ms per loop
for (ms = 0; ms < MS; ms++)
{                 TH0 = PRELOAD_01ms_H;  TL0 = PRELOAD_01ms_L;  
TF0 = 0;         // Clear overflow flag
TR0 = 1;         // Start Timer 0
while (TF0 == 0); // Loop until Timer 0 overflowsTR0 = 0;         // Stop Timer 0
}
}        
Creating a hardware timeout involves a simple variation on this technique, and
allows precise timeout delays to be easily generated."
Book 1,"For example, in Section 6.6 we considered the process of reading from an ADC in
a Philips 8Xc552 microcontroller."
Book 1,"This was the original, potentially dangerous, code:
// Wait until AD conversion finishes (checking ADCI)
while ((ADCON & ADCI) == 0); 137 Meeting real-time constraints8322 Chapter 6 p113-142  21/2/02  9:58 am  Page 137Here is a solution with a hardware timeout, providing a delay of 10 ms which will, with
reasonable accuracy, apply across the whole 8051 family (without code modifica tions):
// Configure Timer 0 as a 16-bit timer TMOD &= 0xF0; // Clear all T0 bits (T1 left unchanged)TMOD |= 0x01; // Set required T0 bits (T1 left unchanged) 
ET0 = 0;     // No interrupts// Simple timeout feature – approx 10 ms
TH0 = PRELOAD_10ms_H; // See Timeout.H for PRELOAD detailsTL0 = PRELOAD_10ms_L;TF0 = 0; // Clear flagTR0 = 1; // Start timer
while (((ADCON & ADCI) == 0) && !TF0);

The Super Loop architecture illustrated in Listing 7.1 is used in many embedded
applications and has formed the basis of all of the example code which we haveconsidered in previous chapters."
Book 1,"From the developer’s perspective, the mainadvantages of this architecture are that it is easy to understand, and that it con-sumes virtually no system memory or CPU resources."
Book 1,"Despite these advantages, Super Loops are not an appropriate basis for all
embedded applications."
Book 1,"A particular limitation with this architecture is that it isvery difficult to execute function X() at precise intervals of time: as we will see,
this is a very significant drawback."

architecture

143chapter7
Creating an embedded
operating system8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 143For example, consider an embedded application that is now in widespread use:
an audio guide (Figure 7.1)."
Book 1,"Such applications are used in museums and galleriesthroughout the world, in order to describe the numbered exhibits to visitors."
Book 1,Theguide can typically be used in two ways.
Book 1,"First, the visitor can select ‘auto pilot’:this will then cause the guide to describe a sequence of exhibits in order, in thefollowing manner:
Item 345 was painted by Selvio Guaranteen early in the 16th century."
Book 1,"At this time,
Guaranteen, who is generally known as a member of the Slafordic School, was …
Now turn to your left, and locate Item 346, a small painting which was until recently
also thought to have been painted by Guarateen but which is now … ."
Book 1,"Alternatively, the visitor can use the device in ‘manual’ mode."
Book 1,"In this case, the
user will be free to wander at leisure around the exhibition and, when he or shefinds an item of interest, they will type in the exhibit number on the electronicguide: they will then hear the relevant commentary."
Book 1,"No matter what technique we use, the basic processing required in this applica-
tion will be the same: we need to generate a long stream of speech from a store ofdata in memory."
Book 1,This will typically involve using a digital-to-analog converter togenerate an analog signal at a rate of at least 5000 samples per second (Figure 7.2).
Book 1,"The need to call the same function repeatedly, at precise intervals, is by no
means restricted to this museum system (or similar systems such as MP3 players).For example, consider a collection of requirements assembled from a range of dif-ferent embedded projects (in no particular order):144 Embedded C

to the frequency components in the signal."
Book 1,In other cases – such as the aircraftautopilot system discussed in the introduction to Chapter 6 – lack of precisetiming may mean that the system becomes unstable.
Book 1,"We cannot obtain precise timing for such activities using the Super Loop archi-
tecture shown in Listing 7.1. Suppose, for example, that we need to start functionX()every 60 ms, and that the function takes 10 ms to complete."
Book 1,"Listing 7.2 illus-
trates one way in which we might adapt the code in Listing 7.1 in order to try andachieve this."
Book 1,"Listing 7.2 Trying to use the Super Loop architecture to execute functions at regular 
intervals
void main(void)
{Init_System();
while(1) // 'for ever' (Super Loop)
{X();         // Call the function (10 ms duration)Delay_50ms(); // Delay for 50 ms}
}
You may recall that we used this basic architecture in our ‘Hello, Embedded World’
program in Chapter 3."
Book 1,"For the purposes of an introductory example, or in situa-tions – such as the simple central-heating controller outlined in Chapter 1 – thisapproach is often adequate."
Book 1,"
However, in the many circumstances where more accurate timing is needed, the
architecture shown in Listing 7.2 will only prove adequate if the following condi-tions are satisfied:
GWe know the precise duration of function X(), and,
GThis duration never varies."
Book 1,"
In practical applications, determining the precise function duration is rarely
straightforward."
Book 1,"Suppose we have a very simple function that does not interactwith the outside world but, instead, performs some internal calculations."
Book 1,"Evenunder these rather restricted circumstances, changes to compiler optimization set-146 Embedded C8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 146tings – even changes to an apparently unrelated part of the program – can alter the
speed at which the function executes."
Book 1,This can make fine-tuning the timing verytedious and error-prone.
Book 1,The second condition is even more problematic.
Book 1,"Often in an embedded system
functions will be required to interact with the outside world in a complex way."
Book 1,Inthese circumstances the function duration will vary according to outside activitiesin a manner over which the programmer has very little control.
Book 1,"Finally, it should also be noted that the code shown in Listing 7.2 is very ineffi-
cient, because most of the processor time is wasted in a delay loop."
Book 1,"7.2 The basis of a simple embedded OS
To obtain periodic function executions – and avoid wasting processor cycles – wecan use interrupts ."
Book 1,"
As we saw in Chapter 2, an interrupt is a hardware mechanism used to notify a
processor that an ‘event’ has taken place."
Book 1,Timer overflows are a particularly effec-tive and widely-used source of interrupts in embedded applications.
Book 1," For example,the 8051 microcontrollers discussed in this book all have an on-chip timer whichcan be set to generate an interrupt (a ‘tick’) at regular and precise intervals of, say, 1millisecond."
Book 1,This interrupt can be used to call an appropriate function periodically.
Book 1,"While the process of handling interrupts may seem rather complicated, creating
interrupt service routines (ISRs) in a high-level language is a straightforwardprocess, as illustrated in Listing 7.3.

void X(void) interrupt INTERRUPT_Timer_2_Overflow
{// This ISR is called every 1 ms
// Place required code here…
}
The link between this function and the timer overflow is made using the Keil key-
word interrupt (included after the function header in the function definition):
void X(void) interrupt INTERRUPT_Timer_2_Overflow
plus the following #define directive:
#define INTERRUPT_Timer_2_Overflow 5
To understand where the ‘5’ comes from, note that the interrupt numbers used in
ISRs directly correspond to the enable bit index of the interrupt source in the 8051IE SFR."
Book 1,"That is, bit 0 of the IE register will be linked to a function using ‘interrupt 0’.Table 7.1 shows the link between the interrupt sources and the required interruptnumbers for the original 8051/8052."

technique."

In the hardware delay code we considered in Chapter 6, we used a code structure
like this:
// Preload values for 50 ms delay
TH0 = 0x3C;      // Timer 0 initial value (High Byte)TL0 = 0xB0;      // Timer 0 initial value (Low Byte)
TF0 = 0;         // Clear overflow flag
TR0 = 1;         // Start timer 0
while (TF0 == 0); // Loop until Timer 0 overflows (TF0 == 1)TR0 = 0;         // Stop Timer 0
In this case, we load the counter registers with an appropriate initial value, run the
timer and wait until it overflows: we then stop the timer."
Book 1,This is appropriatebehaviour for a delay function.
Book 1,"For our operating system, we have slightly different requirements:
GWe require a series of interrupts, generated for a long period, at a precisely-determined intervals."
Book 1,GWe would like to generate these interrupts without imposing a significant loadon the CPU.
Book 1,Timer 2 matches these requirements precisely.
Book 1,"24When Timer 2 overflows, it is
automatically reloaded, and immediately begins counting again."
Book 1,"In this case, thetimer is reloaded using the contents of the ‘capture’ registers (note that the namesof these registers vary slightly between chip manufacturers):
RCAP2H = 0xFC;  // Load Timer 2 reload capt."

This automatic reload facility ensures that the timer keeps generating the required
ticks, at precise 1 ms intervals, with very little software load, and without anyintervention from the user’s program.151 Creating an embedded operating system

Book 1,"As we discussed in Chapter 2, Timer 2 was a component added (by Intel) when the 8052 archi-
tecture was introduced shortly after the launch of the 8051."
Book 1,"Most – but not all – current‘8051s’ include this component.8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 1517.3 Introducing sEOS
The techniques used in Listing 7.3 can be adapted very easily to create the simple
embedded operating system that we require."
Book 1,"For ease of reference, we will refer tothis operating system as ‘sEOS’ in this book."
Book 1,We examine the operation and use ofsEOS here.
Book 1,"a) Complete code listing
To illustrate the use and operation of sEOS, we will re-implement the followingexample using this operating system:

{Init_System();
while(1) // 'for ever' (Super Loop)
{X();         // Call the function (10 ms duration)Delay_50ms(); // Delay for 50 ms}
}
In this case, the sEOS code required to provide the same behaviour is given (in
part) in Listing 7.4 to Listing 7.6. (As in previous example, all of the files for thisproject are included on the CD: to avoid undue repetition, only the key files arepresented here.)

This program uses all of the features discussed in Section 7.2, but arranges the code ina slightly different way, in order to make it easy to adapt for use in different projects.156 Embedded C8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 156b) Tasks, functions and scheduling
Before we consider the implementation of this simple embedded operating system,
we should first say something about the terminology used to describe such systems."
Book 1,"
In discussions about embedded systems, you will frequently hear and read
about ‘task design’, ‘task execution times’ and ‘multi-tasking’ systems."
Book 1,"In this con-text, the term ‘task’ is usually used to refer to a function that is executed on a
periodic basis ."
Book 1,"In the case of sEOS, we are able to control the execution times of a
single task."
Book 1,This process is often referred to as ‘scheduling the task’.
Book 1,"The task willbe implemented as (or called from) an interrupt service routine: this ISR will, inturn, be invoked by the overflow of a timer."
Book 1,"
Note that the task will often call (other) functions in order to meet the needs of
the application."
Book 1,"For example, in the design of a controller for a domestic washingmachine presented in Chapter 8, we will identify one task required by the system,and ten functions to be called from this task."
Book 1,"c) Setting the tick interval
Let us now consider the operation of sEOS in more detail."
Book 1,One of the key featuresof this OS is the way that the tick interval is set.
Book 1,"In the function main() , we can
see that the control of this interval has been largely automated:
// Set up simple EOS (60 ms tick interval)
sEOS_Init_Timer2(60);  
In this example, a tick interval of 60 ms is used: this means that the ISR (the
‘update’ function) at the heart of sEOS will be invoked every 60 ms:
/*---------------------------------------------------------*-
sEOS_ISR()Invoked periodically by Timer 2 overflow: 
see sEOS_Init_Timer2() for timing details."
Book 1,"-*---------------------------------------------------------*/
void sEOS_ISR() interrupt INTERRUPT_Timer_2_Overflow
{...}
The ‘automatic’ tick interval control is achieved using the C pre-processor, and the
information included in the project header file ( Main.H ):157 Creating an embedded operating system8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 157// Oscillator / resonator frequency (in Hz) e.g. (11059200UL)
#define OSC_FREQ (12000000UL)
// Number of oscillations per instruction (12, etc)
…#define OSC_PER_INST (12)
This information is then used to calculate the required timer reload values in
Simple_EOS.C as follows:
// Number of timer increments required (max 65536)
Inc = ((tLong)TICK_MS * (OSC_FREQ/1000)) / (tLong)OSC_PER_INST; 
// 16-bit reload value
Reload_16 = (tWord) (65536UL – Inc);
// 8-bit reload values (High & Low)
Reload_08H = (tByte)(Reload_16 / 256);Reload_08L = (tByte)(Reload_16 % 256);
..."
Book 1,"TH2   = Reload_08H;  // Load T2 high byte
RCAP2H  = Reload_08H;  // Load T2 reload capt."
Book 1,"reg.high byte
TL2   = Reload_08L;  // Load T2 low byte
RCAP2L  = Reload_08L;  // Load T2 reload capt."
Book 1,reg.
Book 1,"low byte
It is very important to understand that, if using a 12 MHz oscillator, then accurate
timing can usually be obtained over a range of tick intervals from 1 ms to 60 ms(approximately)."
Book 1,"However, if using other clock frequencies (such as the popular11.0592 MHz),
25precise timing can only be obtained at a much more limited
range of tick intervals."
Book 1,"If you are developing an application where precise timing isrequired, you must check the timing calculations by hand."
Book 1,"This code inSimple_EOS.C – used in the simulator – can help you check the timing:
// Used for manually checking timing (in simulator)
P2 = Reload_08H;P3 = Reload_08L;158 Embedded C
25."
Book 1,"In applications involving the serial interface, 11.0592 MHz is widely used, as we will see in
Chapter 8."
Book 1,This ‘odd’ frequency is used because it gives rise to acurate baud rate values (e.g.9600 baud).
Book 1,"If you require both accurate baud rates and asccurate EOS timing, use an 11.0592MHz crystal and a tick rate of 5, 10, 15, … 60 or 65 ms."
Book 1,Such ‘divide by 5’ tick rates are precisewith an 11.0592 MHz crystal.
Book 1,"(As an exercise, you might like to confirm this for yourself.)8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 158d) Saving power
One of the problems noted with many ‘Super Loop’ applications is that that the
processor wasted a large number of CPU cycles in a delay loop:
void main(void)
{Init_System();
while(1) // 'for ever' (Super Loop)
{X();          // Perform the task (10 ms duration)Delay_50ms();  // Delay for 50 ms}
}
We noted in Chapter 2 that 8051 devices have an ‘idle’ mode where power con-
sumption may be reduced by a factor of 10 (approximately)."
Book 1,"Using sEOS, we canreduce the power consumption of the application by having the processor enteridle mode when it finishes executing the ISR (Figure 7.4)."
Book 1,"This is achieved through the function sEOS_Go_To_Sleep() : 
/*---------------------------------------------------------*-
sEOS_Go_To_Sleep()This operating system enters 'idle mode' between clock ticks
to save power."
Book 1,"The next clock tick will return the processor
to the normal operating state."

timer next overflows (generating an interrupt)."
Book 1,"Overall, this application is ‘asleep’ for 99.9% of the time, meaning that the total
load imposed by this operating system is around 0.1% of the available CPU capac-ity (Figure 7.5)."
Book 1,"
If we assume that the system is implemented using an Atmel AT89S53 chip, then –
referring back to Table 2.1 – we can see that the power consumption figures areas follows:
In this case, we would expect the average current consumption to be given by:
2 × 99.9 + 11 × 0.1
Average current consumption = ---------------------------------------- = 2.009 mA
100
If the system runs at 5V , the average power consumption will then be: 10.045 mW."
Book 1,"Note that this is the power consumption of the processor itself: if you add LEDs
or other devices to the system, then the power consumption will inevitablyincrease."
Book 1,"In these circumstances, theoretical calculations will only be a guide, andwill you need to take some measurements from a prototype system to determinethe true figure.160 Embedded C

7.4 Using Timer 0 or Timer 1
The example code above used Timer 2 as the source of ticks for the operatingsystem."
Book 1,"In most cases, this is good choice: however, if Timer 2 is not available onyour 8051 device, or is in use for some other purpose, Timer 0 or Timer 1 can beused in its place."
Book 1,"Like Timer 2, Timer 0 and Timer 1 also have an auto-reload capability."
Book 1,"However,
Timer 2 has this facility when used in 16-bit mode whereas Timer 0 and Timer 1can only be reloaded automatically when operating in 8-bit mode."
Book 1,"In typical 8051applications, an 8-bit timer can only be used to generate interrupts at intervals ofaround 0.25 ms (or less)."
Book 1,This can be useful for some applications where very rapidprocessing is required.
Book 1,"However, in most cases, this short tick interval will simplyincrease the processor load imposed by the operating system."
Book 1,"To illustrate the increased load imposed by short tick intervals, Figure 7.6
repeats the example shown in Figure 7.5, this time using a 0.25 ms tick interval.Note that by using the shorter tick interval, the percentage of ‘sleep’ time hasfallen from 99.9% to 74.5%: this reflects the fact that the scheduler ISR is calledmore frequently."
Book 1,"Although the auto-reload modes of Timer 0 and Timer 1 are less useful than the
equivalent mode in Timer 2, Timer 0 and Timer 1 can also be used in ‘manualreload’ mode."
Book 1,"Manual-reload mode means that – when it overflows – the timermust be stopped, loaded with the required count value and then restarted."
Book 1,Withthis approach it is almost impossible to guarantee precise tick intervals.
Book 1,"However,the level of timing accuracy obtained is adequate for many applications.161 Creating an embedded operating system8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 161Listing 7.7 shows the key source code from an operating system based on Timer 0,

Book 1,"a) Starting tasks
The ‘time-triggered’ nature of this system means that functions are started (or‘triggered’) at pre-determined points in time."
Book 1,"
The main alternative to this architecture is referred to as ‘event-triggered’."
Book 1,"In
embedded systems, event-triggered behaviour is often achieved through the use ofinterrupts."
Book 1,"To support these, event-triggered system architectures often providemultiple interrupt service routines."
Book 1,"To understand the difference between event- and time-triggered architectures,
we will first consider an analogy."
Book 1,"Suppose that a hospital doctor must look afterthe needs of ten seriously-ill patients overnight, with the support of some nursingstaff."
Book 1,"The doctor might consider two ways of performing this task:
GThe doctor might arrange for one of the nursing staff to waken her if there is asignificant problem with one of the patients."
Book 1,This is the ‘event triggered’ solution.
Book 1,GThe doctor might set her alarm clock to ring every hour.
Book 1,"When the alarm goesoff, she will get up and visit each of the patients, in turn, to check that they arewell and, if necessary, prescribe treatment."
Book 1,"This is the ‘time triggered’ solution.166 Embedded C
26."
Book 1,"For sources of further information about the use of the embedded operating system described
here on other processors, please refer to Chapter 11.8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 166For most doctors, the event-triggered approach will seem the most attractive,
because they are likely to get a few hours of sleep during the course of the night.By contrast, with the time-triggered approach, the doctor will inevitably suffersleep deprivation."
Book 1,"However, in the case of many embedded systems – which do not need sleep –
the time-triggered approach has many advantages."
Book 1,"Indeed, within industrial sec-tors where safety is an obvious concern, such as the aerospace industry and theautomotive industry, time-triggered techniques are widely used because it isaccepted, both by the system developers (and certification authorities), that theyhelp improve reliability and safety."
Book 1,"The main reason that time-triggered approaches are preferred in safety-related
applications is that they result in systems which have very predictable behaviour."
Book 1,"If
we revisit the hospital analogy, we can begin to see why this is so."
Book 1,"
Suppose that our ‘event triggered’ doctor is sleeping peacefully."
Book 1,"An apparently
minor problem develops with one of the patients, and the nursing staff decide notto awaken the doctor but to deal with the problem themselves."
Book 1,"After another twohours, when four patients have ‘minor’ problems, the nurses decide that they willhave to wake the doctor after all."
Book 1,"As soon as the doctor sees the patients, she rec-ognizes that two of them have a severe complications, and she has to beginsurgery."
Book 1,"Before she can complete the surgery on the first patient, the secondpatient is very close to death."
Book 1,Consider the same example with the ‘time triggered’ doctor.
Book 1,"In this case, because
the patient visits take place at hourly intervals, the doctor sees each patient beforeserious complications arise, and arranges appropriate treatment."
Book 1,"Another way of
viewing this is that the workload is spread out evenly throughout the night ."
Book 1,"As
a result, all of the patients survive the night without difficulty."
Book 1,"In embedded applications, the (rather macabre) hospital situation is mirrored in
the event-driven application by the occurrence of several events (that is, severalinterrupts) at the same time."
Book 1,"This might indicate, for example, that two differentfaults had been detected simultaneously in an aircraft, or simply that two switcheshad been pressed at the same time on a keypad."
Book 1,"
To see why the simultaneous occurrence of two interrupts causes a problem,
consider what happens in the 8051 architecture in these circumstances."
Book 1,"Like manymicrocontrollers, the original 8051 architecture supports two different interruptpriority levels: Low and High."
Book 1,"If two interrupts (we will call them Interrupt 1 andInterrupt 2) occur in rapid succession, the system will behave as follows:167 Creating an embedded operating system8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 167GIf Interrupt 1 is a low-priority interrupt and Interrupt 2 is a high-priority interrupt."
Book 1,"
GIf Interrupt 1 is a low-priority interrupt and Interrupt 2 is also a low-priority
interrupt."
Book 1,"
GIf Interrupt 1 is a high-priority interrupt and Interrupt 2 is a low-priority interrupt."
Book 1,"
GIf Interrupt 1 is a high-priority interrupt and Interrupt 2 is also a high-priorityinterrupt."
Book 1,"168 Embedded C
Note carefully what this means! There is a common misconception among thedevelopers of embedded applications that interrupt events will never be lost.This simply is not true."
Book 1,"If you have multiple sources of interrupts that mayappear at ‘random’ time intervals, interrupt responses can be missed: indeed,where there are several active interrupt sources, it is practically impossible tocreate code that will deal correctly with all possible combinations of interrupts.The ISR invoked by a low-priority interrupt cannot be interrupted by another low-priority interrupt."
Book 1,"As a result the response to the second interrupt will be at the
very least delayed; under some circumstances it will be ignored altogether ."
Book 1,"The interrupt service routine (ISR) invoked by a high-priority interrupt cannot be
interrupted by a low-priority interrupt."
Book 1,"As a result the response to the second
interrupt will be at the very least delayed; under some circumstances it willbe ignored altogether ."
Book 1,"The interrupt service routine (ISR) invoked by a high-priority interrupt cannot be
interrupted by another high-priority interrupt."
Book 1,"As a result the response to the
second interrupt will be at the very least delayed; under some circum-stances it will be ignored altogether .The interrupt service routine (ISR) invoked by a low-priority interrupt can be
interrupted by a high-priority interrupt."
Book 1,"In this case, the low-priority ISR will bepaused, to allow the high-priority ISR to be executed, after which the operationof the low-priority ISR will be completed."
Book 1,"In most cases, the system will operatecorrectly ( provided that the two ISRs do not interfere with one another ).8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 168It is the need to deal with the simultaneous occurrence of more than one event
that both adds to the system complexity and reduces the ability to predict thebehaviour of an event-triggered system under all circumstances."
Book 1,"By contrast, in atime-triggered embedded application, the designer is able to ensure that onlysingle events must be handled at a time, in a carefully controlled sequence."
Book 1,"b) Stopping tasks
As we noted at the start of this section, sEOS has a time-triggered, co-operativelyscheduled, architecture."
Book 1,We have discussed the meaning of ‘time triggered’.
Book 1,Nowwe turn our attention to the co-operative nature of this system.
Book 1,"When we say that an operating system is co-operative, we mean that a task,
once started, will run until it is complete: that is, the OS will never interrupt anactive task."
Book 1,This is a ‘single task’ approach to operating system design.
Book 1,The alterna-tive is a ‘pre-emptive’ or ‘time sliced’ approach.
Book 1,"In a pre-emptive system, tasks willtypically run for – say – a millisecond."
Book 1,"The OS will then pause this task, and runanother task for a millisecond, and so on."
Book 1,"From the perspective of the user, thepre-emptive OS appears to be running multiple tasks at the same time."
Book 1,"Co-operative scheduling is simpler and is generally considered to be more pre-
dictable than pre-emptive scheduling."
Book 1,"To understand why this is, consider that wewish to run two tasks on a pre-emptive system, and that both tasks require accessto the same port."
Book 1,"Suppose that one task is reading from this port, and that thescheduler performs a ‘context switch’, causing the second task to access the sameport: under these circumstances, unless we take action to prevent it, data may belost or corrupted."
Book 1,"
This problem arises frequently in multi-tasking environments where we have
what are known as ‘critical sections’ of code."
Book 1,"Such critical sections are codesegments that – once started – must run to completion, without interruption.Examples of critical sections include:
GCode which modifies or reads variables, particularly global variables used forinter-task communication."
Book 1,"In general, this is the most common form of criticalsection, since inter-task communication is often a key requirement."
Book 1,"GCode which interfaces to hardware, such as ports, analog-to-digital converters(ADCs), and so on."
Book 1,"What happens, for example, if the same ADC is used simul-taneously by more than one task?"
Book 1,GCode which calls common functions.
Book 1,"What happens, for example, if the samefunction is called simultaneously by more than one task?"
Book 1,"In a co-operative system, these problems do not arise, since only one task is ever
active at a time."
Book 1,"169 Creating an embedded operating system8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 169To deal with critical sections of code in a pre-emptive system, we have two
main possibilities:
G‘Pause’ the scheduling by disabling the scheduler interrupt before beginningthe critical section; re-enable the scheduler interrupt when we leave the criticalsection, or;
GUse a ‘lock’ (or some other form of ‘semaphore mechanism’) to achieve a simi-lar result."
Book 1,"
The first solution means that, when we start accessing the shared resource (say
Port X), we disable the scheduler."
Book 1,This solves the immediate problem since (say)Task A will be allowed to run without interruption until it has finished with PortX.
Book 1,"However, this ‘solution’ is less than perfect."
Book 1,"For one thing, by disabling thescheduler, we will no longer be keeping track of the elapsed time and all timingfunctions will begin to drift – in this case by a period up to the duration of Task Aevery time we access Port X."
Book 1,This simply is not acceptable.
Book 1,"The use of locks is a better solution and appears, at first inspection, easy to
implement."
Book 1,"Before entering the critical section of code, we ‘lock’ the associatedresource; when we have finished with the resource we ‘unlock’ it."
Book 1,"While locked,no other process may enter the critical section."
Book 1,"27
This is one way we might try to achieve this: 
1Task A checks the ‘lock’ for Port X it wishes to access."
Book 1,"2If the section is locked, Task A waits."
Book 1,"3When the port is unlocked, Task A sets the lock and then uses the port."
Book 1,"4When Task A has finished with the port, it leaves the critical section and
unlocks the port."
Book 1,"Implementing this algorithm in code also seems straightforward, as illustrated in
Listing 7.8.170 Embedded C
27."
Book 1,"Of course, this is only a partial solution to the problem caused by multi-tasking."
Book 1,"If the purpose
of Task A is to read from an ADC, and Task B has locked the ADC when the Task A is invoked,then Task A cannot carry out its required activity."
Book 1,"Use of locks, or any other mechanism, willnot solve this problem; however, they may prevent the system from crashing.8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 170Listing 7.8 Attempting to implement a simple locking mechanism in a pre-emptive 
scheduler."
Book 1,"See text for details

#define LOCKED     1
bit Lock;  // Global lock flag// ."
Book 1,.
Book 1,".// Ready to enter critical section

// Release the lockLock = UNLOCKED;
// ."
Book 1,.
Book 1,.
Book 1,"However, the above code cannot be guaranteed to work correctly under all cir-
cumstances."
Book 1,"
Consider the part of the code labelled ‘A’ in Listing 7.8. If our system is fully
pre-emptive, then Task A may be at this point when the scheduler performs a con-text switch and allows (say) Task B access to the CPU."
Book 1,"If Task B also requires accessthe Port X, we can then have a situation as follows:
GTask A has checked the lock for Port X and found that the port is not locked;Task A has, however, not yet changed the lock flag."
Book 1,GTask B is then ‘switched in’.
Book 1,Task B checks the lock flag and it is still clear.
Book 1,Task Bsets the lock flag and begins to use Port X.
Book 1,GTask A is ‘switched in’ again.
Book 1,"As far as Task A is concerned, the port is notlocked; this task therefore sets the flag, and starts to use the port, unaware thatTask B is already doing so.171 Creating an embedded operating system
A8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 171As we can see, this simple lock code violates the principal of mutual exclusion : that
is, it allows more than one task to access a critical code section."
Book 1,The problem arisesbecause it is possible for the context switch to occur after a task has checked thelock flag but before the task changes the lock flag.
Book 1,"In other words, the lock
‘check and set code’ (designed to control access to a critical section of code), isitself a critical section ."
Book 1,This problem can be solved.
Book 1,"For example, because it takes little time to ‘check
and set’ the lock code, we can disable interrupts for this period."
Book 1,"However, this isnot in itself a complete solution: because there is a chance that an interrupt mayhave occurred even in the short period of ‘check and set’, we then need to checkthe relevant interrupt flag(s) and – if necessary – call the relevant ISR(s)."
Book 1,"This canbe done, but it adds substantially to the complexity of the operating environment."
Book 1,"c) Reliability matters
As we have discussed, the simple, predictable, nature of time-triggered, co-opera-tively scheduled, applications makes this approach the usual choice insafety-related applications, where reliability is a crucial design requirement.However, the need for reliability is not restricted to systems such as fly-by-wire air-craft and drive-by-wire passenger cars: even at the lowest level, an alarm clock thatfails to sound on time, or a video recorder that operates intermittently may nothave safety implications but, equally, will not have high sales figures."
Book 1,"
In addition to increasing reliability, the use of time-triggered techniques
can help to reduce both CPU loads and memory usage: as a result, even thesmallest of embedded applications can benefit from the use of this form ofsystem architecture."
Book 1,"7.7 Important design considerations when using sEOS
Following on from the discussions in Section 7.6, we consider here two importantfactors which must be taken into account when using sEOS in your own projects."
Book 1,"a) Worst-case task execution time
We noted in Section 7.6 that sEOS has a time-triggered architecture."
Book 1,This has impor-tant implications for the designer of the system.
Book 1,"In particular, the designer must ensurethat the execution time for a task can never exceed the tick interval (Figure 7.8).172 Embedded C8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 172For example, suppose the following situation applies:
GThe operating system has a 10 ms tick interval."
Book 1,GA task runs for 22 milliseconds.
Book 1,"In these circumstances, at least one ‘tick’ will be lost and the system may fail to
operate as required (see Figure 7.9)."
Book 1,These problems can be solved with due care at the design stage.
Book 1,"For example, we
have shown (first in Chapter 3) how simulations can be used to determine taskdurations."
Book 1,We have also considered (in Chapter 6) several different timeout mech-anisms that can help us to meet ‘worst-case execution time’ conditions.
Book 1,"
We make some suggestions for further improvements to this operating system
in Chapter 11: these can help to greatly improve the performance of this system inthe presence of ‘long tasks’."
Book 1,"b) The ‘One Interrupt per Microcontroller’ rule
As we discussed in Section 7.6a, sEOS has a time-triggered architecture."
Book 1,The sEOSinitialization function enables the generation of interrupts associated with theoverflow of one of the microcontroller timers.
Book 1,"To ensure correct operation of thesystem, it is essential that – with the exception of the single timer interrupt driv-ing the OS – all interrupts are disabled.173 Creating an embedded operating system

Book 1,"TimeTask8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 173If you fail to do this, then you are trying to operate sEOS as an ‘event-triggered’
system (see Section 7.6 for details of the problems this can cause)."
Book 1,"We must issue a clear warning:
7.8 Example: Milk pasteurization
We will now consider the use of sEOS in a practical embedded application."
Book 1,"The system discussed in this example is intended to monitor the rate of liquid
(milk) flow through a pasteurization28system."
Book 1,"The monitoring is required prima-
rily because too high a flow rate can result in incomplete sterilization of theproduct, and a consequent reduction in shelf life."
Book 1,"Note that facilities for the measurement of flow rates will probably already be
included as part of the main pasteurization system: our system will reproduce thisbehaviour."
Book 1,This form of ‘redundancy’ is a common requirement in embeddedapplications with safety implications.
Book 1,"Here we assume that it is unlikely that onedevice for measuring flow rates may fail, and very unlikely that both will failsimultaneously."
Book 1,"As a consequence, adding the redundant sensor from this studywill be likely to improve the overall reliability of the system."
Book 1,"a) Measuring the flow rates
To measure the rate of flow, we will be measuring the frequency of a stream ofpulses."
Book 1,"This is a common requirement: for example, many industrial systemsrequire measurement of rotational speed."
Book 1,This is often carried out using a sensor ofthe type illustrated in Figure 7.10.
Book 1,"As the figure illustrates, the rotating shaft gives rise to a pulse train.In the case of the milk production system, we assume that a similar sensor is
used (Figure 7.11)."
Book 1,This (optical) sensor will not exhibit ‘switch bounce’ (seeChapter 4).
Book 1,"However, some older pasteurization systems still employ mechanical174 Embedded C

Book 1,28.
Book 1,"The French chemist Louis Pasteur demonstrated that the spoilage of perishable products could
be prevented by destroying the microbes through a heat treatment and then protecting the(sterilized) material from subsequent contamination."
Book 1,Pasteur applied this theory to the preser-vation of beverages and foodstuffs.
Book 1,His process is now most widely associated with milkproduction.8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 174switches: these pulse streams will exhibit switch bounce.
Book 1,"To make this system as
flexible as possible, we will incorporate debounce behaviour (in software) in oursystem."
Book 1,"This will have no impact on the measurement of pulses from the opticalsensor, but will allow our system to be applied more widely."
Book 1,"b) Output from the program
The output from this program will take two forms:
GA bargraph display, giving the operator an instant visual representation of theflow rate."
Book 1,"GAn audible alarm, which will sound when the flow rate falls below an accept-able level."

7.9 Conclusions
The operating system (‘sEOS’) introduced in this chapter imposes a very lowprocessor load but is nonetheless flexible and useful."
Book 1,"
The simple nature of sEOS also provides other benefits."
Book 1,"For example, it means
that developers themselves can, very rapidly, port the OS onto a new microcon-troller environment."
Book 1,It also means that the architecture may be readily adapted tomeet the needs of a particular application.
Book 1,"However, perhaps the most important side effect of this form of simple OS is that
– unlike a traditional ‘real-time operating system’ – it becomes part of the applica-tion itself (Figure 7.13)."
Book 1,"In our experience, this tight integration of OS andapplication means that developers quickly understand, and claim ownership of,the OS code."
Book 1,"This is important, since it avoids a ‘not invented here’ or ‘blame it onthe OS’ philosophy, which can arise when developers must interface their code toa large and complex real-time operating system, the features and behaviour ofwhich they may never fully understand.187 Creating an embedded operating system8322 Chapter 7 p143-188  21/2/02  10:02 am  Page 187Finally, as we conclude this chapter, we should note that it is possible to create
other, more flexible, operating systems for the 8051 and other processors by build-ing on the techniques presented here: we consider some of the possibilities inChapter 11.188

In Chapter 6, we considered the design of a simple aircraft autopilot system."
Book 1,"We
assumed that the pilot would enter the required course heading and that theautopilot would then monitor the aircraft position and orientation, and – wherenecessary – make changes to the rudder, elevator, aileron and engine settings inorder to keep the aircraft following this path."
Book 1,"
Like the various embedded systems we considered in Chapter 7, this system
involves periodic function calls."
Book 1,"In the case of the autopilot, the various sensorinputs would be measured at pre-determined intervals (typically every 10 ms)."
Book 1,"Theautopilot would then calculate the required system outputs, and make appropriateadjustments to the relevant actuators (Figure 8.1)."
Book 1,"As we saw in Chapter 7, the ability to execute tasks on a periodic basis can be
provided very effectively using a simple operating system like sEOS."
Book 1,"On its own,however, periodic execution of functions would not allow us to meet all therequirements of the autopilot application."
Book 1,"In particular, it would not allow us toexecute the sequence of operations that would be required if we wanted to havethe aircraft follow a preset course, carry out an automated landing or even retractits undercarriage."
Book 1,"This requires us to execute a sequence of functions, in a pre-determined order."
Book 1,"
In most cases, it is helpful to model such systems as a series of states: in each
state, we may read system inputs and / or generate appropriate system outputs."
Book 1,"This architecture is common not only in autopilot systems, but also in auto-
matic car wash systems, industrial robots and traffic lights, all the way through todomestic dishwashers and microwave ovens."

GThey involve a series of system states."
Book 1,"GIn each state, one or more functions may be called."
Book 1,GThere will be rules defining the transitions between states.

FIGURE 8.2 A high-level schematic view of a simple autopilot system in use8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 190The different nature of the rules used to control the transitions between states
allows us to identify two broad categories of multi-state systems:
GMulti-State (Timed)
In a multi-state (timed) system, the transition between states will depend only
on the passage of time."
Book 1,"
For example, the system might begin in State A, repeatedly executing
FunctionA() , for ten seconds."
Book 1,"It might then move into State B and remain
there for five seconds, repeatedly executing FunctionB() ."
Book 1,"It might then move
back into State A, ad infinituum ."
Book 1,"
A basic traffic-light control system might follow this pattern."
Book 1,"GMulti-State (Input/Timed)
This is a more common form of system, in which the transition between states
(and behaviour in each state) will depend both on the passage of time and on
system inputs."
Book 1,"
For example, the system might only move between State A and State B if a
particular input is received within X seconds of a system output being generated."
Book 1,"The autopilot system discussed at the start of this chapter might follow
this pattern, as might a control system for a washing machine, or an intruderalarm system."
Book 1,"For completeness, we will mention one further possibility: 
GMulti-State (Input)
This is a comparatively rare form of system, in which the transition between
states (and behaviour in each state) depends only on the system inputs."
Book 1,"
For example, the system might only move between State A and State B if a
particular input is received."
Book 1,It will remain indefinitely in State A if this input isnot received.
Book 1,"Such systems have no concept of time, and – therefore – no way of imple-
menting timeout or similar behaviours."
Book 1,We will not consider such systems inthis book.
Book 1,"In this chapter, we will consider how the Multi-State (Time) and Multi-State
(Input/Time) architectures can be implemented in C.191 Multi-state systems and function sequences8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 1918.2 Implementing a Multi-State (Timed) system
We can describe the time-driven, Multi-State architecture as follows:
GThe system will operate in two or more states."
Book 1,GEach state may be associated with one or more function calls.
Book 1,"
GTransitions between states will be controlled by the passage of time."
Book 1,GTransitions between states may also involve function calls.
Book 1,"Please note that, in order to ease subsequent maintenance tasks, the system states
should not be arbitrarily named, but should – where possible – reflect a physicalstate observable by the user and / or developer."
Book 1,"For example, a telephone systemwith the set of states {‘State 1’, ‘State 2’, ‘State 3’} may prove more difficult tomaintain than one with states {‘Charging’, ‘In use’, ‘Ringing’}."
Book 1,"
Please also note that the system states will usually be represented by means of a
switch statement in the operating system ISR."
Book 1,We illustrate this architecture in the two examples that follow.
Book 1,"8.3 Example: Traffic light sequencing
Suppose we wish to create a system for driving three traffic light bulbs in a trafficsystem for use in Europe."
Book 1,"The conventional ‘red’, ‘amber’ (orange) and ‘green’bulbs will be used, with European sequencing (Figure 8.3)."
Book 1,"192 Embedded C
FIGURE 8.3 The required light sequence from red, amber and green bulbs in a traffic-light
application (European sequence)Time
Red
AmberGreen8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 192a) Basic system architecture
A basic version of the traffic-light sequencer requires no inputs from the environ-
ment and will perform well by executing a sequence of pre-determinedmanoeuvres."
Book 1,It is a classic example of a Multi-State (Timed) system.
Book 1,"
b) The system states
In this case, the various states are easily identified:
GRed
GRed-Amber
GGreen
GAmber 
In the code, we will represent these states as follows:
// Possible system states
typedef enum {RED, RED_AND_AMBER, GREEN, AMBER} eLight_State;
We will store the time to be spent in each state using appropriate constants:
// Times in each of the (four) possible light states
// (Times are in seconds)//#define RED_DURATION 20#define RED_AND_AMBER_DURATION 5#define GREEN_DURATION 30#define AMBER_DURATION 5
In this simple case, we do not require function calls from (or between) system states:the required behaviour will be implemented directly through control of the (three)port pins which – in the final system – would be connected to appropriate bulbs."
Book 1,"
For example:
case RED: 
{Red_light = ON;Amber_light = OFF;Green_light = OFF;193 Multi-state systems and function sequences8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 193c) Complete implementation

8.4 Example: Animatronic dinosaur
The scheduling of traffic lights is a common example."
Book 1,"In this second example, wewill consider a more complicated system."
Book 1,"The Natural History Museum in London recently installed a robotic dinosaur
among the fossils in their Dinosaur Gallery."
Book 1,"29This large exhibit models a tyran-
nosaurus rex guarding a recent kill: the robot is large, very loud and movesquickly."
Book 1,It has proved to be very popular with visitors.
Book 1,"We will consider here the software architecture that could be used in the imple-
mentation of such a system."
Book 1,"a) Basic system architecture
This system requires no inputs from the environment and will perform well byexecuting a sequence of pre-determined manoeuvres."
Book 1,It is a good example of aMulti-State (Timed) system.
Book 1,"198 Embedded C
29."
Book 1,"There is a video showing the dinosaur in action on the museum website: www.nhm.ac.uk8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 198We will assume that the sequence of manoeuvres will take a few minutes to exe-
cute, and will run approximately every ten minutes."
Book 1,"
To implement a complete system, we would probably prepare a number of
slightly different programs, and execute a program ‘at random’."
Book 1,This would makethe display more interesting for people who choose to watch the show more thanonce.
Book 1,"This option is not implemented in the example code here: however, theapproach used to implement different washing machine programs could beemployed here if you wish to explore this example further (see Section 8.6)."
Book 1,"b) The system states
We will assume that the following system states are to be implemented:
GSleeping:
The dinosaur will be largely motionless, but will be obviously ‘breathing’.Irregular snoring noises, or slight movements during this time will add interestfor the audience."
Book 1,GWaking:The dinosaur will begin to wake up.
Book 1,Eyelids will begin to flicker.
Book 1,Breathing willbecome more rapid.

Book 1,Somefurther movement and growling will follow.
Book 1,GAttacking:Rapid ‘random’ movements towards the audience.
Book 1,Lots of noise (you should beable to hear this from the next floor in the museum).
Book 1,"
In the code, we will represent these states using the enum and typedef keywords,
as follows:
typedef enum {SLEEPING, WAKING, GROWLING, ATTACKING}
eDinosaur_State;
We will also store the time to be spent in each state using appropriate contants:
// Times in each of the (four) possible states
// (Times are in seconds)#define SLEEPING_DURATION 255#define WAKING_DURATION 60#define GROWLING_DURATION 40 #define ATTACKING_DURATION 120
Appropriate functions will also be created to implement the key behaviours:
// ------ Private function prototypes -----------------------
void DINOSAUR_Perform_Sleep_Movements(void);void DINOSAUR_Perform_Waking_Movements(void);void DINOSAUR_Growl(void);void DINOSAUR_Perform_Attack_Movements(void);
We will not be concerned with the implementation of these functions in this
introductory book (Chapter 11 provides suggestions for further reading if youwant to explore this example in more depth)."

8.5 Implementing a Multi-State (Input/Timed) system
As we noted in Section 8.1, the general Multi-State software architecture has twocommon forms."
Book 1,Here we consider how we can create a Multi-State system drivenboth by time and system inputs.
Book 1,"a) Basic design
We can describe the time-and-inout-driven Multi-State architecture as follows:204 Embedded C8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 204GThe system will operate in two or more states."
Book 1,GEach state may be associated with one or more function calls.
Book 1,"
GTransitions between states may be controlled by the passage of time, by system
inputs or by a combination of time and inputs."
Book 1,GTransitions between states may also involve function calls.
Book 1,"b) Implementing state timeouts
We introduced timeout mechanisms in Chapter 6."
Book 1,"As we noted in Chapter 7, such
mechanisms play a key role in applications using sEOS."
Book 1,"When working with Multi-State systems, timeout mechanisms are still impor-
tant: however, in this case we sometimes require what might be described as a‘state timeout’ mechanism."
Book 1,"For example, consider the following – informal – system requirements:
GThe pump should be run for 10 seconds."
Book 1,"If, during this time, no liquid is
detected in the outflow tank, then the pump should be switched off and ‘lowwater’ warning should be sounded."
Book 1,"If liquid is detected, the pump should berun for a further 45 seconds, or until the ‘high water’ sensor is activated(whichever is first)."
Book 1,"GAfter the front door is opened, the correct password must be entered on thecontrol panel within 30 seconds or the alarm will sound."
Book 1,GThe ‘down flap’ signal will be issued.
Book 1,"If, after 5 ms, no flap movement isdetected, it should be concluded that the flap hydraulics are damaged."
Book 1,Thesystem should then alert the user and enter manual mode.
Book 1,"To meet this type of requirement, we will do two things:
GKeep track of the time in each system state."
Book 1,"GIf the time exceeds a pre-determined error value, then we should move to a dif-
ferent state."
Book 1,We illustrate this procedure in the next example.
Book 1,"8.6 Example: Controller for a washing machine 
In this example we consider the design of a controller for a domestic washing
machine (Figure 8.5).205 Multi-state systems and function sequences8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 205Here is a brief description of the way in which we expect the system to operate:
1The user selects a wash program (e.g. ‘Wool’, ‘Cotton’) on the selector dial."
Book 1,2The user presses the ‘Start’ switch.
Book 1,"
3The door lock is engaged."
Book 1,4The water valve is opened to allow water into the wash drum.
Book 1,"5If the wash program involves detergent, the detergent hatch is opened."
Book 1,"When
the detergent has been released, the detergent hatch is closed."
Book 1,"6When the ‘full water level’ is sensed, the water valve is closed."
Book 1,"7If the wash program involves warm water, the water heater is switched on."
Book 1,"When
the water reaches the correct temperature, the water heater is switched off.206 Embedded C

8.7 Conclusions
This chapter has discussed the implementation of Multi-State (Tmed) and Multi-State (Input/Timed) systems."
Book 1,"Used in conjunction with an operating system likethat presented in Chapter 7, this flexible system architecture is in widespread usein embedded applications."
Book 1,"In Chapter 9, we move on to look at the use of the 8051’s serial interface."
Book 1,"215 Multi-state systems and function sequences8322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 21518322 Chapter 8 p189-216  21/2/02  10:03 am  Page 2169.1 Introduction
In Chapter 2, we introduced the 8051 microcontroller and saw that it had the fol-
lowing features:
G32 I/O pins."
Book 1,GAt least two timers.
Book 1,GAn interrupt system.
Book 1,GA serial interface supporting the RS-232 standard.
Book 1,"In previous chapters, we have used the I/O pins for input and output, and the
timers for generating accurate delays."
Book 1,We have also used the timers – and the inter-rupt system – to create a simple embedded operating system.
Book 1,"In this chapter, wecomplete our discussion of 8051 features by examining the serial interface."
Book 1,9.2 What is RS-232?
Book 1,"In 1997 the Telecommunications Industry Association released what is formallyknown as TIA-232 Version F, a serial communication protocol which has been uni-versally referred to as ‘RS-232’ since its first ‘Recommended Standard’ appeared inthe 1960s."
Book 1,Similar standards (V.28) are published by the InternationalTelecommunications Union (ITU) and by CCITT (The Consultative CommitteeInternational Telegraph and Telephone).
Book 1,"The ‘RS-232’ standard includes details of:
217chapter9
Using the serial interface8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 217GThe protocol to be used for data transmission."
Book 1,GThe voltages to be used on the signal lines.
Book 1,GThe connectors to be used to link equipment together.
Book 1,"Overall, the standard is comprehensive and widely used, at data transfer rates of
up to around 115 or 330 kbits / second (115 / 330 k baud)."
Book 1,Data transfer can beover distances of 15 metres or more.
Book 1,Note that RS-232 is a peer-to-peer communication standard.
Book 1,"Unlike – for exam-
ple – the RS-485 standard, RS-232 is intended to link only two devices together."
Book 1,"
9.3 Does RS-232 still matter?"
Book 1,"On the desktop, standards such as USB are rapidly replacing RS-232 as ‘desirable’protocols."
Book 1,Nonetheless – for embedded development – RS-232 remains important.
Book 1,"Some important applications of RS-232 in embedded systems include the following:
GTo program on-chip flash memory (for testing or low-volume production), sev-eral 8051 devices use the serial port."
Book 1,This can also be an important means ofperforming code upgrades to devices in the field.
Book 1,"GMany developers use RS-232 during system development, in order to communi-cate between desktop PCs (on which code is developed) and prototype boards(on which the code is tested)."
Book 1,"For example, since most embedded devices haveno screen or keyboard available, it is useful to be able to send data to and froma desktop PC to clarify program operation."
Book 1,GMany embedded data acquisition and control systems receive instructions fromand / or transfer data to desktop PCs over an RS-232 link.
Book 1,"GEven very recent components, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors,have RS-232 interfaces."
Book 1,"9.4 The basic RS-232 protocol
RS-232 is a byte-oriented protocol."
Book 1,"That is, it is intended to be used to send single8-bit blocks of data."
Book 1,"To transmit a byte of data over an RS-232 link, we generallyencode the information as follows:
GWe send a ‘Start’ bit."
Book 1,GWe send the data (8 bits).
Book 1,GWe send a ‘Stop’ bit (or bits).218 Embedded C8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 218We consider each of these stages below.
Book 1,"Quiescent state
When no data are being sent on an RS-232 ‘transmit’ line, the line is held at a
Logic 1 level."
Book 1,"
Start bit
To indicate the start of a data transmission we pull the ‘transmit’ line low."
Book 1,"Data
Data are often encoded in ASCII (American Standard Code for InformationInterchange), in 7-bit form."
Book 1,The bits are sent least-significant bit first.
Book 1,"If we aresending 7-bit data, the 8th data bit is often used as a simple ‘parity check bit’, inorder to provide a rudimentary error detection facility."
Book 1,"
Note that none of the code presented here uses parity bits: we use all 8 bits for
data transfer."
Book 1,"Stop bit(s)
The stop bits consist of a Logic 1 output."
Book 1,These can be 1 or – less commonly – 1.5or 2 pulses wide.
Book 1,"
Note that we will use a single stop bit in all code examples."
Book 1,"9.5 Asynchronous data transmission and baud rates
RS-232 uses an asynchronous protocol."
Book 1,This means that no clock signal is sent withthe data.
Book 1,"Instead, both ends of the communication link have an internal clock,running at the same rate."
Book 1,"The data (in the case of RS-232, the ‘Start’ bit) is thenused to synchronize the clocks, if necessary, to ensure successful data transfer."
Book 1,RS-232 generally operates at one of a (restricted) range of baud rates.
Book 1,"Typically
these are: 75, 110, 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 33600,56000, 115000 and (rarely) 330000 baud."
Book 1,"Of these, 9600 baud is a very ‘safe’choice, as it is very widely supported.219 Using the serial interface8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 2199.6 Flow control
RS-232 is often used with some form of flow control."
Book 1,"This is a protocol, imple-
mented through software or hardware, that allows a receiver of data to tell thetransmitter to pause the data flow."
Book 1,"This might be necessary, for example, if wewere sending data to a PC, and the PC had filled a RAM buffer: the PC would thentell our embedded application to pause the data transfer until the buffer contentshad been stored on disk."
Book 1,"Although hardware handshaking can be used, this requires extra signal lines."
Book 1,The most common flow control technique is ‘Xon / Xoff’ control.
Book 1,"This requires ahalf- or full-duplex communication link, and can operate as follows:
1Transmitter sends a byte of data."
Book 1,2The receiver is able to receive more data: it does nothing.
Book 1,3The transmitter sends another byte of data.
Book 1,"4Steps 1–3 continue until the receiver cannot accept any more data: it then
sends a ‘Control s’ (Xoff) character back to the transmitter."
Book 1,5The transmitter receives the ‘Xoff’ command and pauses the data transmission.
Book 1,"6When the receiver node is ready for more data, it sends a ‘Control q’ (Xon)
character to the transmitter."
Book 1,7The transmitter resumes the data transmission.
Book 1,8The process continues from Step 1.
Book 1,We illustrate this process in a code library presented in Section 9.12.
Book 1,"9.7 The software architecture
Suppose we wish to transfer data to a PC at a standard 9600 baud; that is, 9600 bits
per second."
Book 1,"As we discussed above, transmitting each byte of data, plus stop andstart bits, involves the transmission of 10 bits of information (assuming a singlestop bit is used)."
Book 1,"As a result, each byte takes approximately 1 ms to transmit."
Book 1,"This has important implications in all applications, not least those using an
embedded operating system like sEOS."
Book 1,"If, for example, we wish to send this infor-mation to the PC:
Current core temperature is 36.678 degrees220 Embedded C8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 220then the task sending these 42 characters will take more than 40 milliseconds to
complete."
Book 1,"This may be an unacceptably long duration if we need to operate with ahigh tick rate of, say 10 ms or less (Figure 9.1)."
Book 1,"Perhaps the most obvious way of addressing this issue is to increase the baud rate;
however, this is not always possible, and – even with very high baud rates – longmessages or irregular bursts of data can still cause difficulties."
Book 1,A complete solution involves a change in the system architecture.
Book 1,"Rather than
sending all of the data at once, we can simply store the data we want to send tothe PC in a buffer (Figure 9.2)."
Book 1,Every ten milliseconds (say) we check the bufferand send the next character (if there is one ready to send).
Book 1,"In this way, all of therequired 43 characters of data will be sent to the PC within 0.5 seconds."
Book 1,This isoften (more than) adequate.
Book 1,"However, if necessary, we can reduce this time bychecking the buffer every millisecond."
Book 1,"Note that because we do not have to waitfor each character to be sent, the process of sending data from the buffer will bevery fast (typically a fraction of a millisecond)."
Book 1,"BufferAll characters
written immediatelyto buffer(very fast operation)
Scheduler sends one
character to PCevery 10 ms(for example)Current core temperature
is 36.678 degrees221 Using the serial interface
FIGURE 9.1 A schematic representation of the problems caused by sending a long character
string on an embedded system with a simple operating system."
Book 1,"In this case, sending themessage takes 32 ms while the OS tick interval is 10 ms."
Book 1,"Please refer back to Chapter 7 forfurther detailsSystem ‘ticks’ TimeRs-232 Task
FIGURE 9.2 A schematic representation of the software architecture used in the RS-232 libraryCurrent core temperature
is 36.678 degrees8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 2219.8 Using the on-chip UART for RS-232 communications
Having decided on the basic architecture for the RS-232 library, we need to con-
sider in more detail how the on-chip serial port is used."
Book 1,"This port is full duplex, meaning it can transmit and receive simultaneously."
Book 1,"It
is also receive-buffered, meaning it can commence reception of a second bytebefore a previously received byte has been read from the receive register.(However, if the first byte still has not been read by the time reception of thesecond byte is complete, one of the bytes will be lost.) 
The serial port can operate in four modes (one synchronous mode, three asyn-
chronous modes)."
Book 1,"In this chapter, we are primarily interested in Mode 1."
Book 1,"In thismode, 10 bits are transmitted (through TxD) or received (through RxD): a start bit(0), 8 data bits (least-significant bit first), and a stop bit (1)."
Book 1,"
Note that the serial interface may also provide interrupt requests when transmission
or reception of a byte has been completed."
Book 1,"However, for reasons discussed in Chapter7, none of the ‘time-triggered’ code used in this chapter will generate interrupts."
Book 1,"a) Serial port registers
The serial port control and status register is the special function register SCON.This register contains the mode selection bits (and the serial port flags, TI and RI)."
Book 1,"
SBUF is the receive and transmit buffer for the serial interface."
Book 1,"Writing to SBUF
loads the transmit register and initiates transmission."
Book 1,Reading from SBUF accessesa physically separate receive register.
Book 1,"b) Baud rate generation using Timer 1
There are several different ways to generate the baud rate clock for the serial portdepending on the mode in which it is operating."
Book 1,"
As noted above, we are primarily concerned here with the use of the serial port
in Mode 1."
Book 1,In this mode the baud rate is determined by the overflow rate of Timer1 or Timer 2.
Book 1,"For reasons discussed in Chapter 7, we assume that, if Timer 2 isavailable, it will be used to drive the operating system."
Book 1,Therefore we focus on theuse of Timer 1 for baud rate generation.
Book 1,"The baud rate is determined by the Timer 1 overflow rate and the value of
SMOD as follows:
2SMOD×FrequencyoscillatorBaud rate (Mode 1) = ---------------------------------------------------------------------
32 ×Instructionscycle×(256 – TH1)222 Embedded C8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 222Where:
SMOD is the ‘double baud rate’ bit in the PCON register;
Frequencyoscillatoris the oscillator / resonator frequency (in Hz);
Instructionscycleis the number of machine instructions per oscillator cycle (e.g. 12 or 6)
TH1 is the reload value for Timer 1
Note that Timer 1 is used in 8-bit auto-reload mode and that interrupt generation
should be disabled."
Book 1,"To see why this is so, we will assume SMOD = 0 (it works equally well with SMOD
= 1), that there are 12 instructions per cycle and that we require a baud rate of9600."
Book 1,"The above equation becomes:
110592009600 = ----------------------------------------------
32 ×12 ×(256 – TH1)
This becomes:
11059200------------------------ = 256 – TH1 
9600 ×384
Or:
256 – TH1 = 3
Thus, if we set TH1 to 253 (0xFD) we get a precise 9600 baud rate."
Book 1,"If – for example – we repeat this with a 12 MHz oscillator, we get:
12000000------------------------ = 256 – TH1 
9600 ×384
Or:
256 – TH1 = 3.255208333333223 Using the serial interface
It is very important to appreciate that it is not generally possible to produce
standard baud rates (e.g. 9600) using Timer 1 (or Timer 2), unless you use an11.0592 MHz crystal oscillator."
Book 1,"8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 223Thus, the required value of TH1 is 252.7447916667."
Book 1,The nearest integer value is 253.
Book 1,"This means that our actual baud rate will be
approximately 10417 baud – more than 8% higher than the required (9600) rate."
Book 1,"c) Other techniques for generating standard baud rates
The frequency 11.0592 MHz may be ideal for generating precise baud rates, but itis not an ideal frequency for driving an embedded operating system of the typepresented in Chapter 7."
Book 1,"One good solution to this problem is to use an 8051 device with a programma-
ble baud-rate generator."
Book 1,"This allows you to use an oscillator frequency compatiblewith the operating system (e.g. 24 MHz), and generate precise baud rates."
Book 1,"The Infineon C515C and C517A are examples of 8051 devices with programma-
ble baud-rate generators."
Book 1,"9.9 Memory requirements
The buffered architecture discussed in this chapter is an effective way of managingthe transmission of messages and data to a desktop PC."
Book 1,"
The biggest problem caused by this approach is the memory load."
Book 1,"The root of
this difficulty is that fact that, as we discussed in above, the architecture used (totransmit data to the PC) involves a buffer to which the user writes as required; thisbuffer is then emptied, one character at a time, by a sEOS task."
Book 1,"30
The buffer itself is very simple (in the code we will describe here):224 Embedded C
Remember: this is an asynchronous protocol, and relies for correct operation
on the fact that both ends of the connection are working at the same baudrate."
Book 1,"In practice, you can work with a difference in baud variations of ±
2.5%."
Book 1,"
Despite this margin, it is always good policy to get the baud rate as close
as possible to the standard value because, in the field , there may be significant
temperature variations between the oscillator in the PC and that in the embed-ded system."
Book 1,"This will lead to a ‘drift’ in baud rates on PC and microcontroller,even if they were precisely the same to start with: as a result, if the baud rateswere initially mismatched, then communication with the PC may fail completelyduring normal use."
Book 1,This type of ‘inexplicable fault’ has caused many developerssleepless nights (‘I don’t understand it! It works fine in all the tests in the lab!’).

Book 1,"Note that while both the ‘transmit’ and (where available) ‘receive’ channels have associated
buffers, the transmit buffer is usually larger than the receive buffer, since – in most cases – thedirection of data flow is from the microcontroller to the PC."
Book 1,"As a result, we focus on the transmitbuffer here."
Book 1,"However, similar concerns – and solutions – apply to the receive buffer in circum-stances where the main direction of information flow is from the PC to the microcontroller.8322 Chapter 9 p217-254  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 224// The transmit buffer length (MAX IS 127; MIN is 1)

GYou can reduce the buffer size."
Book 1,"This may mean that the functions in your appli-
cation must break down the data they send into smaller blocks."
Book 1,"Typically, themain implication is that shorter strings must be used."
Book 1,"GYou can increase the baud rate, and adapt the code so that the system sendsmore than one byte of data in every time the RS-232 ‘update’ function is called."
Book 1,"GIf using on-chip memory only, you can choose an 8051 device with additional on-chip RAM: for example, Dallas and Infineon produce a number of such devices."

This example illustrates how to link a Standard 8051 device to a PC."

Please note that the crystal used is 11.0592 MHz, for reasons discussed in
Section 9.8.
The software is ‘write only’: data is transferred from the microcontroller to the
PC but not vice versa."

In this example, we will use a Serial Menu architecture to control a remote robot.Such devices are used for inspecting the inside of gas pipes and for landminedetection or bomb disposal."
Book 1,"In our simplified example, the robot is power by two stepper motors (Figure 9.5)."
Book 1,"Such motors rotate a fixed amount (typically 7.5°) in response to an applied voltage252 Embedded C

Book 1,"By
‘stepping’ one or both motors, we can control the direction of movement."
Book 1,"Output from the system running in the simulator is shown in Figure 9.6.
Complete code for this example is given on the CD."
Book 1,"9.14 Conclusions
In this chapter, we have examined how the serial interface on the 8051 microcon-troller may be used in practical embedded systems involving data transfers to (orfrom) a desktop PC, or similar device."

Book 1,"This study illustrates how the key
techniques discussed throughout this book may be used, in combination, in orderto create substantial and reliable systems.253 Using the serial interface

In this case study, we will consider the design and implementation of a small
intruder alarm system suitable for detecting attempted thefts in a home or busi-ness environment."
Book 1,"
As an example of a typical application of this type of system, Figure 10.1 shows
a small art gallery containing three statues."

Case study: 
Intruder alarm system
FIGURE 10.1 A small art gallery containing three statues: we will consider the design of an
intruder alarm system suitable for use in this environmentDoor Window
Statue8322 Chapter 10 p255-284  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 255Figure 10.2 shows the same gallery with the alarm system installed."
Book 1,"In this figure,
each of the windows has a sensor to detect class breakage."
Book 1,A magnetic sensor isalso attached to the door.
Book 1,"In each case, the sensors appear to be simple switches asfar as the alarm system is concerned."
Book 1,Figure 10.2 also shows a ‘bell box’ outsidethe property: this will sound if an intruder is detected.
Book 1,"Inside the door (in Figure 10.2), we have the alarm control panel: this consists
mainly of a small keypad, plus an additional ‘buzzer’ to indicate that the alarmhas sounded (Figure 10.3)."
Book 1,The alarm system is designed in such a way that theuser – having set the alarm by entering a four-digit password – has time to openthe door and leave the room before the monitoring process starts.
Book 1,"Similarly, if theuser opens the door when the system is armed, he or she will have time to enterthe password before the alarm begins to sound.256 Embedded C

GWhen initially activated, the system is in ‘Disarmed ’ state."
Book 1,"
GIn Disarmed state, the sensors are ignored."
Book 1,The alarm does not sound.
Book 1,"The
system remains in this state until the user enters a valid password via thekeypad (in our demonstration system, the password is ‘1234’)."
Book 1,"When a validpassword is entered, the systems enters ‘Arming
’ state."
Book 1,"GIn Arming state, the system waits for 60 seconds, to allow the user to leave the
area before the monitoring process begins."
Book 1,"After 60 seconds, the system enters‘Armed
’ state."
Book 1,"GIn Armed state, the status of the various system sensors is monitored."
Book 1,"If a
window sensor is tripped,31the system enters ‘Intruder ’ state."
Book 1,"If the door sensor
is tripped, the system enters ‘Disarming ’ state."
Book 1,"The keypad activity is also moni-
tored: if a correct password is typed in, the system enters ‘Disarmed ’ state."
Book 1,"
GIn Disarming state, we assume that the door has been opened by someone who
may be an authorized system user."
Book 1,"The system remains in this state for up to 60seconds, after which – by default – it enters Intruder
state."
Book 1,"If, during the 60-
second period, the user enters the correct password, the system enters‘Disarmed
’ state."
Book 1,"
GIn Intruder state, an alarm will sound."
Book 1,"The alarm will keep sounding (indefi-
nitely), until the correct password is entered."
Book 1,"Overall, our demonstration system is somewhat simplified, but the overall systemarchitecture is correct, and the code may be easily extended to add additional features."
Book 1,"10.2 The software architecture
As the description above makes clear, this system translates naturally into a multi-state task, of the type discussed in Chapter 8."
Book 1,"10.3 Key software components used in this example
This case study uses the following software components:
GSoftware to control external port pins (to activate the external bell), as intro-duced in Chapter 3.257 Case study: Intruder alarm system
31."
Book 1,"In our demonstration system, only a single window sensor is mentioned.8322 Chapter 10 p255-284  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 257GSwitch reading, as discussed in Chapter 4, to process the inputs from the door
and window sensors."
Book 1,Note that – in this simple example (intended for use inthe simulator) – no switch debouncing is carried out.
Book 1,"This feature can be added,if required, without difficulty."
Book 1,"GThe embedded operating system, sEOS, introduced in Chapter 7."
Book 1,"GA simple ‘keypad’ library, based on a bank of switches."
Book 1,Note that – to simplifythe use of the keypad library in the simulator – we have assumed the presenceof only eight keys in the example program (0 – 7).
Book 1,This final system wouldprobably use at least 10 keys (see Figure 10.3): support for additional keys canbe easily added if required.
Book 1,GThe RS-232 library (from Chapter 9) is used to illustrate the operation of theprogram.
Book 1,"This library would not be necessary in the final system (but it mightbe useful to retain it, to support system maintenance)."

10.6 Conclusions
This case study has illustrated most of the key features of embedded C, as dis-cussed throughout the earlier chapters in this book.283 Case study: Intruder alarm system8322 Chapter 10 p255-284  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 28318322 Chapter 10 p255-284  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 28411.1 Introduction
In this closing chapter, we review the material that has been presented throughout
this introductory book, and consider some further topics that you will need toconsider if you want to learn more about embedded systems."
Book 1,11.2 Have we achieved our aims?
Book 1,"As we stated in the preface, this book was intended to provide an introduction toembedded software for people who:
GAlready knew how to write software for ‘desktop’ computer systems."
Book 1,"GWere familiar with a C-based language (Java, C++ or C)."
Book 1,GWanted to learn how C is used in practical embedded systems.
Book 1,"In previous chapters, we have covered a lot of essential material."
Book 1,"To summarize:
GWe have considered the choice of processor and programming language for
embedded systems."
Book 1,"GWe have shown how to exploit key object-oriented design and programmingfeatures in embedded C programs, with the aim of making it easier to re-usecode in subsequent projects."
Book 1,GWe have described the Super Loop software architecture used in many simpleembedded applications.
Book 1,"285chapter11
Where do we go from here?8322 Chapter 11 p285-290  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 285GWe have described a simple embedded operating system, suitable for use in a
wide range of embedded applications."
Book 1,"This operating system, driven by timerinterrupts, provides very accurate control over system timing but uses less than1% of the available processor power."
Book 1,GWe have explored techniques for controlling the state of individual port pins.
Book 1,GWe have examined the reading of port pins and mechanical switches.
Book 1,GWe have described how to use the 8051’s serial port.
Book 1,"GWe have presented a case study, to illustrate how all of the above materialcomes together in a real application."
Book 1,"11.3 Suggestions for further study
If you are still keen to learn more about embedded systems, then some suggestionsfor further study are made in this section."
Book 1,"a) Hardware issues
This introductory book has used a hardware simulator to introduce key aspects ofembedded software."
Book 1,"This is a good way to begin work in this area, not leastbecause it allows you to concentrate on getting the software right without havingto worry about possible wiring errors."
Book 1,"However, we have gone as far as we can with a simulator."
Book 1,"Some aspects of hard-
ware cannot be ignored if you want to progress further in this area."
Book 1,"Some key areasthat you need to address are:
GDesigns for oscillator and reset circuits."
Book 1,GTechniques for connecting external ROM and RAM memory.
Book 1,GInterface circuits suitable for controlling low- and high-voltage DC and AC loads.
Book 1,"b) LCD and LED displays
Many embedded applications make use of LCD or LED displays."
Book 1,"These require par-ticular programming techniques that we have not been able to consider in thisintroductory book.286 Embedded C8322 Chapter 11 p285-290  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 286c) Monitoring and control
Many embedded applications serve monitoring or control functions."
Book 1,"This requires
– for example – the use of analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters,pulse-width modulation, and suitable control algorithms (such as the ubiquitousPID algorithm)."
Book 1,"d) Operating systems
The simple operating system (OS) presented in this book is able to control a singleperiodic task."
Book 1,We have not been able to consider OSs suitable for use with morethan one task.
Book 1,"In addition, a drawback with the simple OS presented in this book was that – in
response to a task longer than the tick interval – the system would ‘lose ticks’(Figure 11.1)."
Book 1,"
This type of OS is not suitable for use in high-reliability applications."
Book 1,"e) Multi-processor systems
All of the applications we have considered in this book have contained only one
embedded processor."
Book 1,"However, in practice, an intruder alarm system (of the typeconsidered in Chapter 10) might well contain 6 processors, distributed in the vari-ous sensors and the control panel, while a modern car will typically contain 50embedded processors."
Book 1,"Overall, multi-processor applications are becoming increas-ingly common."
Book 1,Such processors may be linked together by means of a popularserial standard such as RS-485 or the CAN bus.
Book 1,287 Where do we go from here?
Book 1,"FIGURE 11.1 Losing ticks as a result of executing a 22 ms task using an OS with a 10 ms tick
intervalSystem ‘ticks’..."
Book 1,"TimeTask8322 Chapter 11 p285-290  21/2/02  10:04 am  Page 28711.4 Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems
If you are looking for a more advanced book on embedded systems after you finish
this book, then Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems (PTTES ) may be
of interest.32
PTTES is a large (1000-page) book that covers all of the topics highlighted in the
previous section."
Book 1,"The overall approach is the same as this introductory book, butPTTES covers this material at a more advanced level, and in more depth than was
appropriate here."
Book 1,"PTTES also discusses hardware design for microcontroller-based
systems."
Book 1,"In total, more than 70 patterns are described, complete with guidelines tohelp you apply these techniques in your own projects: full source code for all ofthe patterns is included on the PTTES CD."
Book 1,"The patterns described in PTTES include:
GHardware patterns describing reset, oscillator and memory circuits."
Book 1,"Numerous
complete hardware schematics for 8051-based designs are included."
Book 1,GSeveral complete schedulers (‘operating systems’) for both single-processor andmulti-processor applications.
Book 1,"These schedulers can support the scheduling of multi-ple tasks, and are able to deal safely with tasks longer than the system tick interval."
Book 1,"GUser-interface designs using switches, keypads, LED and liquid-crystal displays."
Book 1,"GPatterns for RS-232, RS-485, CAN, SPI and I2C serial communications."
Book 1,GPatterns for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion using both on-chip and external hardware.
Book 1,GPatterns for pulse-width modulation (PWM).
Book 1,"
GPatterns for control-system design (including implementations of industry-standard ‘PID’ algorithms)."
Book 1,"11.5 Embedded Operating Systems
Like the present book, PTTES focuses on the use of the 8051 microcontroller."
Book 1,"As
we discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.5), the co-operative, time-triggered operatingsystems introduced in this book are used with a very wide range of embeddedsystems."
Book 1,"If you would like to learn more about the design and implementation of operat-
ing systems for embedded environments, then a forthcoming book – Embedded
Operating Systems (EOS) – may be of interest."

Book 2,"CHAPTER	ONE
1."
Book 2,"I	SHOULD	HAVE	BEEN	A	STATISTIC
We	found	hell	in	a	beautiful	neighborhood."
Book 2,"In	1981,	Williamsville	offered	the
tastiest	real	estate	in	Buffalo,	New	York."
Book 2,"Leafy	and	friendly,	its	safe	streets	were
dotted	with	dainty	homes	filled	with	model	citizens."
Book 2,"Doctors,	attorneys,	steel
plant	executives,	dentists,	and	professional	football	players	lived	there	with	their
adoring	wives	and	their	2.2	kids."
Book 2,"Cars	were	new,	roads	swept,	possibilities
endless."
Book 2,"We’re	talking	about	a	living,	breathing	American	Dream."
Book 2,"Hell	was	a
corner	lot	on	Paradise	Road."
Book 2,"That’s	where	we	lived	in	a	two-story,	four-bedroom,	white	wooden	home	with
four	square	pillars	framing	a	front	porch	that	led	to	the	widest,	greenest	lawn	in
Williamsville."
Book 2,"We	had	a	vegetable	garden	out	back	and	a	two-car	garage	stocked
with	a	1962	Rolls	Royce	Silver	Cloud,	a	1980	Mercedes	450	SLC,	and,	in	the
driveway,	a	sparkling	new	1981	black	Corvette."
Book 2,"Everyone	on	Paradise	Road
lived	near	the	top	of	the	food	chain,	and	based	on	appearances,	most	of	our
neighbors	thought	that	we,	the	so-called	happy,	well-adjusted	Goggins	family,
were	the	tip	of	that	spear."
Book 2,"But	glossy	surfaces	reflect	much	more	than	they
reveal."
Book 2,"They’d	see	us	most	weekday	mornings,	gathered	in	the	driveway	at	7	a.m.	My
dad,	Trunnis	Goggins,	wasn’t	tall	but	he	was	handsome	and	built	like	a	boxer."
Book 2,"He	wore	tailored	suits,	his	smile	warm	and	open."
Book 2,"He	looked	every	bit	the
successful	businessman	on	his	way	to	work."
Book 2,"My	mother,	Jackie,	was	seventeen
years	younger,	slender	and	beautiful,	and	my	brother	and	I	were	clean	cut,	well
dressed	in	jeans	and	pastel	Izod	shirts,	and	strapped	with	backpacks	just	like	the
other	kids."
Book 2,The	white	kids.
Book 2,"In	our	version	of	affluent	America,	each	driveway
was	a	staging	ground	for	nods	and	waves	before	parents	and	children	rode	off	to
work	and	school."
Book 2,Neighbors	saw	what	they	wanted.
Book 2,Nobody	probed	too	deep.
Book 2,Good	thing.
Book 2,"The	truth	was,	the	Goggins	family	had	just	returned	home	from
another	all-nighter	in	the	hood,	and	if	Paradise	Road	was	Hell,	that	meant	I	lived
with	the	Devil	himself."
Book 2,"As	soon	as	our	neighbors	shut	the	door	or	turned	thecorner,	my	father’s	smile	morphed	into	a	scowl."
Book 2,"He	barked	orders	and	went
inside	to	sleep	another	one	off,	but	our	work	wasn’t	done."
Book 2,"My	brother,	Trunnis
Jr.,	and	I	had	somewhere	to	be,	and	it	was	up	to	our	sleepless	mother	to	get	us
there."
Book 2,"I	was	in	first	grade	in	1981,	and	I	was	in	a	school	daze,	for	real."
Book 2,"Not	because	the
academics	were	hard—at	least	not	yet—but	because	I	couldn’t	stay	awake."
Book 2,"The
teacher’s	sing-song	voice	was	my	lullaby,	my	crossed	arms	on	my	desk,	a	comfy
pillow,	and	her	sharp	words—once	she	caught	me	dreaming—an	unwelcome
alarm	clock	that	wouldn’t	stop	blaring."
Book 2,Children	that	young	are	infinite	sponges.
Book 2,"They	soak	up	language	and	ideas	at	warp	speed	to	establish	a	fundamental
foundation	upon	which	most	people	build	life-long	skills	like	reading	and
spelling	and	basic	math,	but	because	I	worked	nights,	I	couldn’t	concentrate	on
anything	most	mornings,	except	trying	to	stay	awake."
Book 2,Recess	and	PE	were	a	whole	different	minefield.
Book 2,"Out	on	the	playground	staying
lucid	was	the	easy	part."
Book 2,The	hard	part	was	the	hiding.
Book 2,Couldn’t	let	my	shirt	slip.
Book 2,Couldn’t	wear	shorts.
Book 2,"Bruises	were	red	flags	I	couldn’t	show	because	if	I	did,	I
knew	I’d	catch	even	more."
Book 2,"Still,	on	that	playground	and	in	the	classroom	I	knew
I	was	safe,	for	a	little	while	at	least."
Book 2,"It	was	the	one	place	he	couldn’t	reach	me,	at
least	not	physically."
Book 2,"My	brother	went	through	a	similar	dance	in	sixth	grade,	his
first	year	in	middle	school."
Book 2,"He	had	his	own	wounds	to	hide	and	sleep	to	harvest,
because	once	that	bell	rang,	real	life	began."
Book 2,"The	ride	from	Williamsville	to	the	Masten	District	in	East	Buffalo	took	about	a
half	an	hour,	but	it	may	as	well	have	been	a	world	away."
Book 2,"Like	much	of	East
Buffalo,	Masten	was	a	mostly	black	working-class	neighborhood	in	the	inner
city	that	was	rough	around	the	edges;	though,	in	the	early	1980s,	it	was	not	yet
completely	ghetto	as	fuck."
Book 2,"Back	then	the	Bethlehem	Steel	plant	was	still
humming	and	Buffalo	was	the	last	great	American	steel	town."
Book 2,"Most	men	in	the
city,	black	and	white,	worked	solid	union	jobs	and	earned	a	living	wage,	which
meant	business	in	Masten	was	good."
Book 2,"For	my	dad,	it	always	had	been."
Book 2,"By	the	time	he	was	twenty	years	old	he	owned	a	Coca-Cola	distribution
concession	and	four	delivery	routes	in	the	Buffalo	area."
Book 2,"That’s	good	money	for	a
kid,	but	he	had	bigger	dreams	and	an	eye	on	the	future."
Book 2,"His	future	had	four
wheels	and	a	disco	funk	soundtrack."
Book 2,"When	a	local	bakery	shut	down,	he	leased
the	building	and	built	one	of	Buffalo’s	first	roller	skating	rinks.Fast-forward	ten	years	and	Skateland	had	been	relocated	to	a	building	on	Ferry
Street	that	stretched	nearly	a	full	block	in	the	heart	of	the	Masten	District."
Book 2,"He
opened	a	bar	above	the	rink,	which	he	named	the	Vermillion	Room."
Book 2,"In	the
1970s,	that	was	the	place	to	be	in	East	Buffalo,	and	it’s	where	he	met	my	mother
when	she	was	just	nineteen	and	he	was	thirty-six."
Book 2,"It	was	her	first	time	away	from
home."
Book 2,Jackie	grew	up	in	the	Catholic	Church.
Book 2,"Trunnis	was	the	son	of	a	minister,
and	knew	her	language	well	enough	to	masquerade	as	a	believer,	which	appealed
to	her."
Book 2,But	let’s	keep	it	real.
Book 2,She	was	just	as	drunk	on	his	charm.
Book 2,Trunnis	Jr.	was	born	in	1971.
Book 2,"I	was	born	in	1975,	and	by	the	time	I	was	six	years
old,	the	roller	disco	craze	was	at	its	absolute	peak."
Book 2,Skateland	rocked	every	night.
Book 2,"We’d	usually	get	there	around	5	p.m.,	and	while	my	brother	worked	the
concession	stand—popping	corn,	grilling	hot	dogs,	loading	the	cooler,	and
making	pizzas—I	organized	the	skates	by	size	and	style."
Book 2,"Each	afternoon,	I	stood
on	a	step	stool	to	spray	my	stock	with	aerosol	deodorizer	and	replace	the	rubber
stoppers."
Book 2,"That	aerosol	stink	would	cloud	all	around	my	head	and	live	in	my
nostrils."
Book 2,My	eyes	looked	permanently	bloodshot.
Book 2,"It	was	the	only	thing	I	could
smell	for	hours."
Book 2,"But	those	were	the	distractions	I	had	to	ignore	to	stay	organized
and	on	hustle."
Book 2,"Because	my	dad,	who	worked	the	DJ	booth,	was	always	watching,
and	if	any	of	those	skates	went	missing,	it	meant	my	ass."
Book 2,"Before	the	doors
opened	I’d	polish	the	skate	rink	floor	with	a	dust	mop	that	was	twice	my	size.Skateland,	age	six
At	around	6	p.m.,	my	mother	called	us	to	dinner	in	the	back	office."
Book 2,"That	woman
lived	in	a	permanent	state	of	denial,	but	her	maternal	instinct	was	real,	and	it
made	a	big	fucking	show	of	itself,	grasping	for	any	shred	of	normalcy."
Book 2,"Every
night	in	that	office,	she’d	set	out	two	electric	burners	on	the	floor,	sit	with	her
legs	curled	behind	her,	and	prepare	a	full	dinner—roast	meat,	potatoes,	green
beans,	and	dinner	rolls,	while	my	dad	did	the	books	and	made	calls."
Book 2,"The	food	was	good,	but	even	at	six	and	seven	years	old	I	knew	our	“familydinner”	was	a	bullshit	facsimile	compared	to	what	most	families	had."
Book 2,"Plus,	we
ate	fast."
Book 2,"There	was	no	time	to	enjoy	it	because	at	7	p.m.	when	the	doors	opened,
it	was	show	time,	and	we	all	had	to	be	in	our	places	with	our	stations	prepped."
Book 2,"My	dad	was	the	sheriff,	and	once	he	stepped	into	the	DJ	booth	he	had	us
triangulated."
Book 2,"He	scanned	that	room	like	an	all-seeing	eye,	and	if	you	fucked	up
you’d	hear	about	it."
Book 2,Unless	you	felt	it	first.
Book 2,"The	room	didn’t	look	like	much	under	the	harsh,	overhead	house	lights,	but	once
he	dimmed	them,	the	show	lights	bathed	the	rink	in	red	and	glanced	off	the
spinning	mirror	ball,	conjuring	a	skate	disco	fantasy."
Book 2,"Weekend	or	weeknight,
hundreds	of	skaters	piled	through	that	door."
Book 2,"Most	of	the	time	they	came	in	as	a
family,	paying	their	$3	entrance	fee	and	half-dollar	skate	fee	before	hitting	the
floor."
Book 2,I	rented	out	the	skates	and	managed	that	entire	station	by	myself.
Book 2,"I	carried	that
step	stool	around	like	a	crutch."
Book 2,"Without	it,	the	customers	couldn’t	even	see	me."
Book 2,"The	bigger-sized	skates	were	down	below	the	counter,	but	the	smaller	sizes	were
stored	so	high	I’d	have	to	scale	the	shelves,	which	always	made	the	customers
laugh."
Book 2,Mom	was	the	one	and	only	cashier.
Book 2,"She	collected	everyone’s	cover
charge,	and	to	Trunnis,	money	was	everything."
Book 2,"He	counted	the	people	as	they
came	in,	calculating	his	take	in	real	time	so	he	had	a	rough	idea	of	what	to
expect	when	he	counted	out	the	register	after	we	closed	up."
Book 2,"And	it	had	better	all
be	there."
Book 2,All	the	money	was	his.
Book 2,The	rest	of	us	never	earned	a	cent	for	our	sweat.
Book 2,"In	fact,
my	mother	was	never	given	any	money	of	her	own."
Book 2,"She	had	no	bank	account	or
credit	cards	in	her	name."
Book 2,"He	controlled	everything,	and	we	all	knew	what	would
happen	if	her	cash	drawer	ever	came	up	short."
Book 2,"None	of	the	customers	who	came	through	our	doors	knew	any	of	this,	of	course."
Book 2,"To	them,	Skateland	was	a	family-owned-and-operated	dream	cloud."
Book 2,"My	dad
spun	the	fading	vinyl	echoes	of	disco	and	funk	and	the	early	rumbles	of	hip	hop."
Book 2,"Bass	bounced	off	the	red	walls,	courtesy	of	Buffalo’s	favorite	son	Rick	James,
George	Clinton’s	Funkadelic,	and	the	first	tracks	ever	released	by	hip	hop
innovators	Run	DMC."
Book 2,Some	of	the	kids	were	speed	skating.
Book 2,"I	liked	to	go	fast
too,	but	we	had	our	share	of	skate	dancers,	and	that	floor	got	funky."
Book 2,"For	the	first	hour	or	two	the	parents	stayed	downstairs	and	skated,	or	watchedtheir	kids	spin	the	oval,	but	they	would	eventually	leak	upstairs	to	make	their
own	scene,	and	when	enough	of	them	made	their	move,	Trunnis	slipped	out	of
the	DJ	booth	so	he	could	join	them."
Book 2,"My	dad	was	considered	the	unofficial	mayor
of	Masten,	and	he	was	a	phony	politician	to	the	core."
Book 2,"His	customers	were	his
marks,	and	what	they	didn’t	know	was	that	no	matter	how	many	drinks	he
poured	on	the	house	and	bro	hugs	he	shared,	he	didn’t	give	a	fuck	about	any	of
them."
Book 2,They	were	all	dollar	signs	to	him.
Book 2,"If	he	poured	you	a	drink	for	free,	it	was
because	he	knew	you	would	buy	two	or	three	more."
Book 2,"While	we	had	our	share	of	all-night	skates	and	twenty-four-hour	skate
marathons,	the	Skateland	doors	typically	closed	at	10	p.m.	That’s	when	my
mother,	brother,	and	I	went	to	work,	fishing	bloody	tampons	out	of	shit-filled
toilets,	airing	the	lingering	cannabis	haze	out	of	both	bathrooms,	scraping
bacteria-loaded	gum	off	the	rink	floor,	cleaning	the	concession	kitchen,	and
taking	inventory."
Book 2,"Just	before	midnight,	we’d	slog	into	the	office,	half-dead."
Book 2,"Our
mother	would	tuck	my	brother	and	me	beneath	a	blanket	on	the	office	sofa,	our
heads	opposite	one	another,	as	the	ceiling	shook	with	the	sound	of	bass-heavy
funk."
Book 2,Mom	was	still	on	the	clock.
Book 2,"As	soon	as	she	stepped	inside	the	bar,	Trunnis	had	her	working	the	door	or
hustling	downstairs	like	a	booze	mule	to	fetch	cases	of	liquor	from	the	basement."
Book 2,"There	was	always	some	menial	task	to	perform	and	she	didn’t	stop	moving,
while	my	father	kept	watch	from	his	corner	of	the	bar	where	he	could	take	in	the
whole	scene."
Book 2,"In	those	days,	Rick	James,	a	Buffalo	native	and	one	of	my	father’s
closest	friends,	stopped	by	whenever	he	was	in	town,	parking	his	Excalibur	on
the	sidewalk	out	front."
Book 2,"His	car	was	a	billboard	that	let	the	hood	know	a
Superfreak	was	in	the	house."
Book 2,He	wasn’t	the	only	celebrity	that	came	through.
Book 2,"OJ
Simpson	was	one	of	the	NFL’s	biggest	stars,	and	he	and	his	Buffalo	Bills
teammates	were	regulars,	as	was	Teddy	Pendergrass	and	Sister	Sledge."
Book 2,"If	you
don’t	know	the	names,	look	them	up."
Book 2,"Maybe	if	I	had	been	older,	or	my	father	had	been	a	good	man,	I	might	have	had
some	pride	in	being	part	of	a	cultural	moment	like	that,	but	young	kids	aren’t
about	that	life."
Book 2,"It’s	almost	like,	no	matter	who	our	parents	are	and	what	they	do,
we’re	all	born	with	a	moral	compass	that’s	properly	tuned."
Book 2,"When	you’re	six,
seven,	or	eight	years	old,	you	know	what	feels	right	and	what	feels	way	the	fuckoff."
Book 2,"And	when	you	are	born	into	a	cyclone	of	terror	and	pain,	you	know	it
doesn’t	have	to	be	that	way,	and	that	truth	nags	at	you	like	a	splinter	in	your
jacked	up	mind."
Book 2,"You	can	choose	to	ignore	it,	but	the	dull	throbbing	is	always
there	as	the	days	and	nights	bleed	together	into	one	blurred	memory."
Book 2,"Some	moments	do	stick	out	though,	and	one	I’m	thinking	of	right	now	still
haunts	me."
Book 2,"That	was	the	night	my	mom	stepped	into	the	bar	before	she	was
expected	and	found	my	dad	sweet	talking	a	woman	about	ten	years	her	junior."
Book 2,"Trunnis	saw	her	watching	and	shrugged	while	my	mother	eyeballed	him	and
slugged	two	shots	of	Johnnie	Walker	Red	to	calm	her	nerves."
Book 2,"He	noticed	her
reaction	and	didn’t	like	it	one	damn	bit."
Book 2,She	knew	how	things	were.
Book 2,"That	Trunnis	ran	prostitutes	across	the	border	to	Fort
Erie	in	Canada."
Book 2,"A	summer	cottage	belonging	to	the	president	of	one	of	Buffalo’s
biggest	banks	doubled	as	his	pop-up	brothel."
Book 2,"He	introduced	Buffalo	bankers	to
his	girls	whenever	he	needed	a	longer	line	of	credit,	and	those	loans	always
came	through."
Book 2,"My	mom	knew	the	young	woman	she	was	watching	was	one	of
the	girls	in	his	stable."
Book 2,She’d	seen	her	before.
Book 2,"Once,	she	walked	in	on	them
fucking	on	the	Skateland	office	sofa,	where	she	tucked	her	children	in	damn	near
every	night."
Book 2,"When	she	found	them	together,	the	woman	smiled	at	her."
Book 2,"Trunnis
shrugged."
Book 2,"No,	my	mom	wasn’t	clueless,	but	seeing	it	with	her	own	eyes	always
burned."
Book 2,"Around	midnight,	my	mother	drove	with	one	of	our	security	guards	to	make	a
bank	deposit."
Book 2,He	begged	her	to	leave	my	father.
Book 2,"He	told	her	to	leave	that	very
night."
Book 2,Maybe	he	knew	what	was	coming.
Book 2,"She	did	too,	but	she	couldn’t	run
because	she	had	no	independent	means	whatsoever,	and	she	wasn’t	going	to
leave	us	in	his	hands."
Book 2,"Plus,	she	had	no	rights	to	community	property	because
Trunnis	had	always	refused	to	marry	her,	which	was	a	riddle	she	was	only	then
starting	to	solve."
Book 2,"My	mother	came	from	a	solid,	middle	class	family,	and	had
always	been	the	virtuous	type."
Book 2,"He	resented	that,	treated	his	hookers	better	than
the	mother	of	his	sons,	and	as	a	result	he	had	her	trapped."
Book 2,"She	was	100	percent
dependent,	and	if	she	wanted	to	leave,	she’d	have	to	walk	with	nothing	at	all."
Book 2,My	brother	and	I	never	slept	well	at	Skateland.
Book 2,"The	ceiling	shook	too	much
because	the	office	was	directly	below	the	dance	floor."
Book 2,"When	my	mother	walked
in	that	night	I	was	already	awake."
Book 2,"She	smiled,	but	I	noticed	the	tears	in	her	eyes
and	remember	smelling	the	scotch	on	her	breath	when	she	scooped	me	up	in	herarms	as	tenderly	as	she	could."
Book 2,"My	father	trailed	in	after	her,	sloppy	and	annoyed."
Book 2,"He	pulled	a	pistol	from	beneath	the	cushion	where	I	slept	(yes,	you	read	that
right,	there	was	a	loaded	gun	under	the	cushion	on	which	I	slept	at	six	years
old!),	flashed	it	at	me,	and	smiled	before	concealing	it	beneath	his	pant	leg	in	an
ankle	holster."
Book 2,"In	his	other	hand	were	two	brown	paper	shopping	bags	filled	with
nearly	$10,000	in	cash."
Book 2,So	far	it	was	a	typical	night.
Book 2,"My	parents	didn’t	speak	on	the	drive	home,	though	the	tension	between	them
simmered."
Book 2,"My	mom	pulled	into	the	driveway	on	Paradise	Road	just	before	6
a.m.,	a	little	early	by	our	standards."
Book 2,"Trunnis	stumbled	from	the	car,	disabled	the
alarm,	dropped	the	cash	on	the	kitchen	table,	and	went	upstairs."
Book 2,"We	followed
him,	and	she	tucked	us	both	into	our	beds,	kissed	me	on	the	forehead,	and	turned
out	the	light	before	slipping	into	the	master	suite	where	she	found	him	waiting,
stroking	his	leather	belt."
Book 2,"Trunnis	didn’t	appreciate	being	glared	at	by	my	mom,
especially	in	public."
Book 2,"“This	belt	came	all	the	way	from	Texas	just	to	whip	you,”	he	said,	calmly."
Book 2,"Then
he	started	swinging	it,	buckle	first."
Book 2,"Sometimes	my	mother	fought	back,	and	she
did	that	night."
Book 2,She	threw	a	marble	candlestick	at	his	head.
Book 2,"He	ducked	and	it
thudded	the	wall."
Book 2,"She	ran	into	the	bathroom,	locked	the	door,	and	cowered	on
the	toilet."
Book 2,He	kicked	the	door	down	and	backhanded	her	hard.
Book 2,"Her	head	slammed
into	the	wall."
Book 2,"She	was	barely	conscious	when	he	grabbed	a	fistful	of	her	hair	and
dragged	her	down	the	hall."
Book 2,"By	then	my	brother	and	I	had	heard	the	violence,	and	we	watched	him	drag	her
all	the	way	down	the	stairs	to	the	first	floor,	then	crouch	over	her	with	the	belt	in
his	hand."
Book 2,"She	was	bleeding	from	the	temple	and	the	lip,	and	the	sight	of	her
blood	lit	a	fuse	in	me."
Book 2,In	that	moment	my	hatred	overcame	my	fear.
Book 2,"I	ran
downstairs	and	jumped	on	his	back,	slammed	my	tiny	fists	into	his	back,	and
scratched	at	his	eyes."
Book 2,I’d	caught	him	off	guard	and	he	fell	to	one	knee.
Book 2,"I	wailed
on	him."
Book 2,“Don’t	hit	my	mom!”	I	yelled.
Book 2,"He	tossed	me	to	the	ground,	stalked	toward	me,
belt	in	hand,	then	turned	toward	my	mother."
Book 2,"“You’re	raising	a	gangster,”	he	said,	half-smiling."
Book 2,I	curled	into	a	ball	when	he	started	swinging	his	belt	at	me.
Book 2,I	could	feel	bruisesrise	on	my	back	as	my	mom	crawled	toward	the	control	pad	near	the	front	door.
Book 2,She	pressed	the	panic	button	and	the	house	exploded	in	alarm.
Book 2,"He	froze,	looked
toward	the	ceiling,	mopped	his	brow	with	his	sleeve,	took	a	deep	breath,	looped
and	buckled	his	belt,	and	went	upstairs	to	wash	off	all	that	evil	and	hate."
Book 2,"Police
were	on	their	way,	and	he	knew	it."
Book 2,My	mother’s	relief	was	short-lived.
Book 2,"When	the	cops	arrived,	Trunnis	met	them	at
the	door."
Book 2,"They	looked	over	his	shoulder	toward	my	mom,	who	stood	several
paces	behind	him,	her	face	swollen	and	caked	with	dried	blood."
Book 2,"But	those	were
different	days."
Book 2,There	was	no	#metoo	back	then.
Book 2,"That	shit	didn’t	exist,	and	they
ignored	her."
Book 2,Trunnis	told	them	it	was	all	a	whole	lot	of	nothing.
Book 2,"Just	some
necessary	domestic	discipline."
Book 2,“Look	at	this	house.
Book 2,Does	it	look	like	I	mistreat	my	wife?”	He	asked.
Book 2,"“I	give	her
mink	coats,	diamond	rings,	I	bust	my	ass	to	give	her	everything	she	wants,	and
she	throws	a	marble	candlestick	at	my	head."
Book 2,"She’s	spoiled.”
The	police	chuckled	along	with	my	father	as	he	walked	them	to	their	car."
Book 2,"They
left	without	interviewing	her."
Book 2,He	didn’t	hit	her	again	that	morning.
Book 2,"He	didn’t
have	to."
Book 2,The	psychological	damage	was	done.
Book 2,"From	that	point	on	it	was	clear	to
us	that	as	far	as	Trunnis	and	the	law	were	concerned	it	was	open	season,	and	we
were	the	hunted."
Book 2,"Over	the	next	year,	our	schedule	didn’t	change	much	and	the	beatings	continued,
while	my	mother	tried	to	paper	over	the	darkness	with	swatches	of	light."
Book 2,"She
knew	I	wanted	to	be	a	Scout,	so	she	signed	me	up	for	a	local	troop."
Book 2,"I	still
remember	putting	on	that	navy	blue	Cub	Scout	button	down	one	Saturday."
Book 2,"I	felt
proud	wearing	a	uniform	and	knowing	at	least	for	a	few	hours	I	could	pretend
that	I	was	a	normal	kid."
Book 2,My	mom	smiled	as	we	headed	for	the	door.
Book 2,"My	pride,
her	smile,	wasn’t	just	because	of	the	damn	Cub	Scouts."
Book 2,"They	rose	up	from	a
deeper	place."
Book 2,"We	were	taking	action	to	find	something	positive	for	ourselves	in	a
bleak	situation."
Book 2,"It	was	proof	that	we	mattered,	and	that	we	weren’t	completely
powerless."
Book 2,That’s	when	my	father	came	home	from	the	Vermillion	Room.
Book 2,“Where	you	two	going?”	He	glared	at	me.
Book 2,I	stared	at	the	floor.
Book 2,"My	mother
cleared	her	throat.“I’m	taking	David	to	his	first	Cub	Scout	meeting,”	she	said,	softly."
Book 2,"“The	hell	you	are!”	I	looked	up,	and	he	laughed	as	my	eyes	welled	up	with	tears."
Book 2,"“We’re	going	to	the	track.”
Within	the	hour	we’d	arrived	at	Batavia	Downs,	an	old-school	harness	horse
race	track,	the	type	where	jockeys	ride	behind	the	horses	in	lightweight	buggies."
Book 2,My	dad	grabbed	a	racing	form	as	soon	we	stepped	through	the	gate.
Book 2,"For	hours,
the	three	of	us	watched	him	place	bet	after	bet,	chain	smoke,	drink	scotch,	and
raise	holy	hell	as	every	pony	he	bet	on	finished	out	of	the	money."
Book 2,"With	my	dad
raging	at	the	gambling	gods	and	acting	a	fool,	I	tried	to	make	myself	as	small	as
possible	whenever	people	walked	by,	but	I	still	stuck	out."
Book 2,"I	was	the	only	kid	in
the	stands	dressed	like	a	Cub	Scout."
Book 2,"I	was	probably	the	only	black	Cub	Scout
they’d	ever	seen,	and	my	uniform	was	a	lie."
Book 2,I	was	a	pretender.
Book 2,"Trunnis	lost	thousands	of	dollars	that	day,	and	he	wouldn’t	shut	up	about	it	on
the	drive	home,	his	raspy	throat	raw	from	nicotine."
Book 2,"My	brother	and	I	were	in	the
cramped	back	seat	and	whenever	he	spat	out	the	window,	his	phlegm
boomeranged	into	my	face."
Book 2,"Each	drop	of	his	nasty	saliva	on	my	skin	burned	like
venom	and	intensified	my	hate."
Book 2,"I’d	long	since	learned	that	the	best	way	to	avoid
a	beat	down	was	to	make	myself	as	invisible	as	possible,	avert	my	eyes,	float
outside	my	body,	and	hope	to	go	unnoticed."
Book 2,"It	was	a	practice	we’d	all	honed
over	the	years,	but	I	was	done	with	that	shit."
Book 2,"I	would	no	longer	hide	from	the
Devil."
Book 2,"That	afternoon	as	he	veered	onto	the	highway	and	headed	home,	he
continued	to	rave	on,	and	I	mad-dogged	him	from	the	back	seat."
Book 2,"Have	you	ever
heard	the	phrase,	“Faith	Over	Fear”?"
Book 2,For	me	it	was	Hate	Over	Fear.
Book 2,He	caught	my	eyes	in	the	rearview	mirror.
Book 2,"“You	got	something	to	say?!”
“We	shouldn’t	have	gone	to	the	track	anyway,”	I	said."
Book 2,My	brother	turned	and	stared	at	me	like	I’d	lost	my	damn	mind.
Book 2,"My	mother
squirmed	in	her	seat."
Book 2,"“Say	that	one	more	time.”	His	words	came	slow,	dripping	with	dread."
Book 2,"I	didn’t
say	a	word,	so	he	started	reaching	behind	the	seat	trying	to	smack	me."
Book 2,"But	I	wasso	small,	it	was	easy	to	hide."
Book 2,"The	car	veered	left	and	right	as	he	was	half-turned
in	my	direction,	punching	air."
Book 2,"He’d	barely	touched	me,	which	only	stoked	his
fire."
Book 2,We	drove	in	silence	until	he	caught	his	breath.
Book 2,"“When	we	get	home,	you’re
gonna	take	your	clothes	off,”	he	said."
Book 2,"That’s	what	he’d	say	when	he	was	ready	to	bestow	a	serious	beat	down,	and
there	was	no	avoiding	it."
Book 2,I	did	what	I	was	told.
Book 2,"I	went	into	my	bedroom	and	took
off	my	clothes,	walked	down	the	hall	to	his	room,	closed	the	door	behind	me,
turned	the	lights	off,	then	laid	across	the	corner	of	the	bed	with	my	legs
dangling,	my	torso	stretched	out	in	front	of	me,	and	my	ass	exposed."
Book 2,"That	was
the	protocol,	and	he’d	designed	it	for	maximum	psychological	and	physical	pain."
Book 2,"The	beatings	were	often	brutal,	but	the	anticipation	was	the	worst	part."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t
see	the	door	behind	me,	and	he’d	take	his	time,	letting	my	dread	build."
Book 2,"When	I
heard	him	open	the	door,	my	panic	spiked."
Book 2,"Even	then	the	room	was	so	dark	I
couldn’t	see	much	with	my	peripheral	vision,	and	couldn’t	prepare	for	the	first
smack	until	his	belt	hit	my	skin."
Book 2,It	was	never	just	two	or	three	lickings	either.
Book 2,"There	was	no	particular	count,	so	we	never	knew	when	or	if	he	was	gonna	stop."
Book 2,This	beating	lasted	minutes	upon	minutes.
Book 2,"He	started	on	my	butt,	but	the	sting
was	so	bad	I	blocked	it	with	my	hands,	so	he	moved	down	and	started	whipping
my	thighs."
Book 2,When	I	dropped	my	hands	to	my	thighs	he	swung	at	my	lower	back.
Book 2,"He	belted	me	dozens	of	times,	and	was	breathless,	coughing	and	slick	with	sweat
by	the	time	it	was	over."
Book 2,"I	was	breathing	heavy	too,	but	I	wasn’t	crying."
Book 2,"His	evil
was	too	real	and	my	hate	gave	me	courage."
Book 2,"I	refused	to	give	that	motherfucker
the	satisfaction."
Book 2,"I	just	stood	up,	looked	the	Devil	in	his	eye,	limped	to	my	room,
and	stood	in	front	of	a	mirror."
Book 2,"I	was	covered	in	welts	from	my	neck	to	the	crease
at	the	knees."
Book 2,I	didn’t	go	to	school	for	several	days.
Book 2,"When	you’re	getting	beat	consistently,	hope	evaporates."
Book 2,"You	stifle	your
emotions,	but	your	trauma	off-gasses	in	unconscious	ways."
Book 2,"After	countless
beatings	she	endured	and	witnessed,	this	particular	beat	down	left	my	mother	in
a	constant	fog,	a	shell	of	the	woman	I	remembered	from	a	few	years	before."
Book 2,"She
was	distracted	and	vacant	most	of	the	time,	except	when	he	called	her	name."
Book 2,Then	she’d	hop-to	like	she	was	his	slave.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	until	years	later	that	she
was	considering	suicide."
Book 2,My	brother	and	I	took	our	pain	out	on	each	other.
Book 2,We’d	sit	or	stand	across	fromone	another	and	he	would	throw	punches	as	hard	as	he	could	at	me.
Book 2,"It	usually
started	out	as	a	game,	but	he	was	four	years	older,	much	stronger,	and	he
connected	with	all	his	power."
Book 2,"Whenever	I’d	fall,	I’d	get	up	and	he’d	hit	me
again,	as	hard	as	he	could,	yelling	like	a	martial	arts	warrior	at	the	top	of	his
lungs,	his	face	twisted	with	rage."
Book 2,“You’re	not	hurting	me!	Is	that	all	you	fucking	have?”	I’d	shout	back.
Book 2,"I	wanted
him	to	know	that	I	could	take	more	pain	than	he	could	ever	deliver,	but	when	it
was	time	to	fall	asleep	and	there	were	no	more	battles	to	fight,	no	place	to	hide,	I
wet	the	bed."
Book 2,Nearly	every	night.
Book 2,My	mother’s	every	day	was	a	lesson	in	survival.
Book 2,"She	was	told	she	was	worthless
so	often	she	started	to	believe	it."
Book 2,"Everything	she	did	was	an	effort	to	appease	him
so	he	wouldn’t	beat	her	sons	or	whip	her	ass,	but	there	were	invisible	trip	wires
in	her	world	and	sometimes	she	never	knew	when	or	how	she	set	them	off	until
after	he	slapped	the	shit	out	of	her."
Book 2,"Other	times	she	knew	she	teed	herself	up	for
a	vicious	beat	down."
Book 2,"One	day	I	came	home	early	from	school	with	a	nasty	earache	and	laid	down	on
my	mother’s	side	of	their	bed,	my	left	ear	throbbing	in	excruciating	pain."
Book 2,"With
each	throb	my	hate	spiked."
Book 2,"I	knew	I	wouldn’t	be	going	to	the	doctor	because	my
father	didn’t	approve	of	spending	his	money	on	doctors	or	dentists."
Book 2,"We	didn’t
have	health	insurance,	a	pediatrician,	or	a	dentist."
Book 2,"If	we	got	injured	or	sick,	we
were	told	to	shake	it	off	because	he	wasn’t	down	to	pay	for	anything	that	didn’t
directly	benefit	Trunnis	Goggins."
Book 2,"Our	health	didn’t	meet	that	standard,	and	that
pissed	me	the	fuck	off."
Book 2,"After	about	a	half	hour,	my	mother	came	upstairs	to	check	on	me	and	when	I
rolled	onto	my	back	she	could	see	blood	dribbling	down	the	side	of	my	neck	and
smeared	all	over	the	pillow."
Book 2,"“That’s	it,”	she	said,	“come	with	me.”
She	got	me	out	of	bed,	dressed	me,	and	helped	me	to	her	car,	but	before	she
could	start	the	engine,	my	dad	chased	us	down."
Book 2,"“Where	you	think	you’re	going?!”“The	emergency	room,”	she	said	as	she	turned	the	ignition."
Book 2,"He	reached	for	the
handle	but	she	peeled	out	first,	leaving	him	in	her	dust."
Book 2,"Furious,	he	stomped
inside,	slammed	the	door,	and	called	out	to	my	brother."
Book 2,"“Son,	get	me	a	Johnnie	Walker!”	Trunnis	Jr.	brought	over	a	bottle	of	Red	Label
and	a	glass	from	the	wet	bar."
Book 2,"He	poured	and	poured	and	watched	my	dad	down
shot	after	shot."
Book 2,Each	one	fueled	an	inferno.
Book 2,"“You	and	David	need	to	be	strong,”
he	raved."
Book 2,"“I’m	not	raising	a	bunch	of	faggots!	And	that’s	what	you’ll	be	if	you
go	to	the	doctor	every	time	you	get	a	little	boo	boo,	understand?”	My	brother
nodded,	petrified."
Book 2,"“Your	last	name	is	Goggins,	and	we	shake	it	off!”
According	to	the	doctor	we	saw	that	night,	my	mother	got	me	to	the	ER	just	in
time."
Book 2,"My	ear	infection	was	so	bad	that	if	we’d	waited	any	longer,	I	would	have
lost	my	hearing	in	my	left	ear	for	life."
Book 2,"She	risked	her	ass	to	save	mine	and	we
both	knew	she’d	pay	for	it."
Book 2,We	drove	home	in	eerie	silence.
Book 2,"My	dad	was	still	stewing	at	the	kitchen	table	by	the	time	we	turned	onto	Paradise
Road,	and	my	brother	was	still	pouring	him	shots."
Book 2,"Trunnis	Jr.	feared	our	father,
but	he	also	worshipped	the	man	and	was	under	his	spell."
Book 2,"As	the	first	born	son	he
was	treated	better."
Book 2,"Trunnis	would	still	lash	out	at	him,	but	in	his	warped	mind,
Trunnis	Jr.	was	his	prince."
Book 2,"“When	you	grow	up	I’m	gonna	want	to	see	you	be	the
man	of	your	house,”	Trunnis	told	him."
Book 2,"“And	you’re	gonna	see	me	be	a	man
tonight.”
Moments	after	we	walked	through	the	front	door,	Trunnis	beat	our	mother
senseless,	but	my	brother	couldn’t	watch."
Book 2,"Whenever	the	beatings	exploded	like	a
thunderstorm	overhead,	he’d	wait	them	out	in	his	room."
Book 2,"He	ignored	the	darkness
because	the	truth	was	way	too	heavy	for	him	to	carry."
Book 2,"I	always	paid	close
fucking	attention."
Book 2,"During	the	summers,	there	was	no	midweek	respite	from	Trunnis,	but	my
brother	and	I	learned	to	hop	on	our	bikes	and	stay	far	away	for	as	long	as	we
could."
Book 2,"One	day,	I	came	home	for	lunch	and	entered	the	house	through	the	garage
like	normal."
Book 2,"My	father	usually	slept	deep	into	the	afternoon,	so	I	figured	the
coast	was	clear."
Book 2,I	was	wrong.
Book 2,My	father	was	paranoid.
Book 2,"He	did	enough	shady
deals	to	attract	some	enemies,	and	he’d	set	the	alarm	after	we	left	the	house."
Book 2,"When	I	opened	the	door,	sirens	screamed	and	my	stomach	dropped."
Book 2,"I	froze,backed	up	against	the	wall,	and	listened	for	footsteps."
Book 2,"I	heard	the	stairs	creak	and
knew	I	was	fucked."
Book 2,"He	came	downstairs	in	his	brown	terrycloth	robe,	pistol	in
hand,	and	crossed	from	the	dining	room	into	the	living	room,	his	gun	out	front."
Book 2,"I
could	see	the	barrel	come	around	the	corner	slowly."
Book 2,"As	soon	as	he	cleared	the	corner	he	could	see	me	standing	just	twenty	feet	away,
but	he	didn’t	drop	his	weapon."
Book 2,He	aimed	it	right	between	my	eyes.
Book 2,"I	stared
straight	at	him,	blank	as	possible,	my	feet	anchored	to	the	floor	boards."
Book 2,"There
was	no	one	else	in	the	house,	and	part	of	me	expected	him	to	pull	the	trigger,	but
by	this	time	in	my	life	I	no	longer	cared	if	I	lived	or	died."
Book 2,"I	was	an	exhausted
eight-year-old	kid,	plain	old	fucking	tired	of	being	terrified	of	my	father,	and	I
was	sick	of	Skateland	too."
Book 2,"After	a	minute	or	two	he	lowered	his	weapon	and
went	back	upstairs."
Book 2,By	now	it	was	becoming	clear	that	someone	was	going	to	die	on	Paradise	Road.
Book 2,My	mother	knew	where	Trunnis	kept	his	.38.
Book 2,"Some	days	she	timed	and	followed
him—envisioned	how	it	would	play	out."
Book 2,"They’d	take	separate	cars	to	Skateland,
she’d	grab	his	gun	from	beneath	the	office	sofa	cushions	before	he	could	get
there,	bring	us	home	early,	put	us	to	bed,	and	wait	for	him	by	the	front	door	with
his	gun	in	hand."
Book 2,"When	he	pulled	up,	she’d	step	out	the	front	door	and	murder
him	in	his	driveway—leave	his	body	for	the	milkman	to	find."
Book 2,"My	uncles,	her
brothers,	talked	her	out	of	it,	but	they	agreed	she	needed	to	do	something	drastic
or	she’d	be	the	one	lying	dead."
Book 2,It	was	an	old	neighbor	who	showed	her	a	way.
Book 2,"Betty	used	to	live	across	the
street	from	us	and	after	she	moved	they	stayed	in	touch."
Book 2,"Betty	was	twenty	years
older	than	my	mom	and	had	the	wisdom	to	match."
Book 2,"She	encouraged	my	mother	to
plan	her	escape	weeks	in	advance."
Book 2,"The	first	step	was	getting	a	credit	card	in	her
name."
Book 2,"That	meant	she	had	to	re-earn	Trunnis’	trust	because	she	needed	him	to
cosign."
Book 2,Betty	also	reminded	my	mother	to	keep	their	friendship	a	secret.
Book 2,"For	a	few	weeks	Jackie	played	Trunnis,	treated	him	like	she	did	when	she	was	a
nineteen-year-old	beauty	with	stars	in	her	eyes."
Book 2,"She	made	him	believe	she
worshipped	him	again,	and	when	she	slipped	a	credit	card	application	in	front	of
him,	he	said	he’d	be	happy	to	score	her	a	little	buying	power."
Book 2,"When	the	card
arrived	in	the	mail,	my	mother	felt	its	hard	plastic	edges	through	the	envelope	as
relief	saturated	her	mind."
Book 2,She	held	it	at	arms	length	and	admired	it.
Book 2,"It	glowed
like	a	golden	ticket.A	few	days	later	she	heard	my	father	talking	shit	about	her	on	the	phone	to	one
of	his	friends,	while	he	was	having	breakfast	with	my	brother	and	me	at	the
kitchen	table."
Book 2,That	did	it.
Book 2,"She	walked	over	to	the	table	and	said,	“I’m	leaving
your	father."
Book 2,"You	two	can	stay	or	you	can	come	with	me.”
My	dad	was	stunned	silent	and	so	was	my	brother,	but	I	shot	out	of	that	chair
like	it	was	on	fire,	grabbed	a	few	black	garbage	bags,	and	went	upstairs	to	start
packing."
Book 2,My	brother	eventually	started	gathering	his	things	too.
Book 2,"Before	we	left,
the	four	of	us	had	one	last	pow	wow	at	that	kitchen	table."
Book 2,"Trunnis	glared	at	my
mother,	filled	with	shock	and	contempt."
Book 2,"“You	have	nothing	and	you	are	nothing	without	me,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“You’re
uneducated,	you	don’t	have	any	money	or	prospects."
Book 2,"You’ll	be	a	prostitute	inside
a	year.”	He	paused	then	shifted	his	focus	to	my	brother	and	me."
Book 2,"“You	two	are
gonna	grow	up	to	be	a	couple	of	faggots."
Book 2,"And	don’t	think	about	coming	back,
Jackie."
Book 2,"I’ll	have	another	woman	here	to	take	your	place	five	minutes	after	you
leave.”
She	nodded	and	stood."
Book 2,"She’d	given	him	her	youth,	her	very	soul,	and	she	was
finally	finished."
Book 2,She	packed	as	little	of	her	past	as	possible.
Book 2,"She	left	the	mink
coats	and	the	diamond	rings."
Book 2,"He	could	give	them	to	his	whore	girlfriend	as	far	as
she	was	concerned."
Book 2,"Trunnis	watched	us	load	up	into	my	mom’s	Volvo	(the	one	vehicle	he	owned
that	he	wouldn’t	ride	in),	our	bikes	already	strapped	to	the	back."
Book 2,"We	drove	off
slowly	and	at	first	he	didn’t	budge,	but	before	she	turned	the	corner	I	could	see
him	move	toward	the	garage."
Book 2,My	mother	floored	it.
Book 2,"Give	her	credit,	she’d	planned	for	contingencies."
Book 2,"She	figured	he’d	tail	her,	so	she
didn’t	head	west	to	the	interstate	that	would	take	us	to	her	parent’s	place	in
Indiana."
Book 2,"Instead,	she	drove	to	Betty’s	house,	down	a	dirt	construction	road	that
my	dad	didn’t	even	know	about."
Book 2,"Betty	had	the	garage	door	open	when	we
arrived."
Book 2,We	pulled	in.
Book 2,"Betty	yanked	the	door	down,	and	while	my	father	shot	out
on	the	highway	in	his	Corvette	to	chase	after	us,	we	waited	right	under	his	nose
until	just	before	nightfall."
Book 2,"By	then	we	knew	he’d	be	at	Skateland,	opening	up."
Book 2,"He
wasn’t	going	to	miss	a	chance	to	make	some	money."
Book 2,No	matter	what.
Book 2,Shit	went	wrong	about	ninety	miles	outside	of	Buffalo	when	the	old	Volvostarted	burning	oil.
Book 2,"Huge	plumes	of	inky	exhaust	choked	from	the	tail	pipe	and
my	mother	spun	into	panic	mode."
Book 2,"It	was	as	if	she’d	been	holding	it	all	in,
stuffing	her	fear	down	deep,	hiding	it	beneath	a	mask	of	forced	composure,	until
an	obstacle	emerged	and	she	fell	apart."
Book 2,Tears	streaked	her	face.
Book 2,"“What	do	I	do?”	My	mom	asked,	her	eyes	wide	as	saucers."
Book 2,"My	brother	never
wanted	to	leave,	and	he	told	her	to	turn	around."
Book 2,I	was	riding	shotgun.
Book 2,"She	looked
over	expectantly."
Book 2,"“What	do	I	do?”
“We	gotta	go,	mom,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“Mom,	we	gotta	go.”
She	pulled	into	a	gas	station	in	the	middle	of	nowhere."
Book 2,"Hysterical,	she	rushed	to
a	pay	phone	and	called	Betty."
Book 2,"“I	can’t	do	this,	Betty,”	she	said."
Book 2,“The	car	broke	down.
Book 2,"I	have	to	go	back!”
“Where	are	you?”	Betty	asked,	calmly."
Book 2,"“I	don’t	know,”	my	mom	replied."
Book 2,"“I	have	no	idea	where	I	am!”
Betty	told	her	to	find	a	gas	station	attendant—every	station	had	those	back	then
—and	put	him	on	the	phone."
Book 2,"He	explained	we	were	just	outside	of	Erie,
Pennsylvania,	and	after	Betty	gave	him	some	instructions,	he	put	my	mother
back	on	the	line."
Book 2,"“Jackie,	there’s	a	Volvo	dealer	in	Erie."
Book 2,"Find	a	hotel	tonight	and	take	the	car	there
tomorrow	morning."
Book 2,"The	attendant	is	going	to	put	enough	oil	in	the	car	to	get	you
there.”	My	mother	was	listening	but	she	didn’t	respond."
Book 2,“Jackie?
Book 2,"Are	you
hearing	me?"
Book 2,"Do	what	I	say	and	it	will	be	okay.”
“Yeah."
Book 2,"Okay,”	she	whispered,	emotionally	spent."
Book 2,“Hotel.
Book 2,Volvo	dealer.
Book 2,"Got	it.”
I	don’t	know	what	Erie	is	like	now,	but	back	then	there	was	only	one	decent
hotel	in	town:	a	Holiday	Inn,	not	far	from	the	Volvo	dealership."
Book 2,"My	brother	and
I	followed	my	mom	to	the	reception	desk	where	we	were	hit	with	more	bad
news."
Book 2,They	were	fully	booked.
Book 2,My	mother’s	shoulders	slumped.
Book 2,"My	brother	and
I	stood	on	either	side	of	her,	holding	our	clothes	in	black	trash	bags."
Book 2,"We	were	the
picture	of	desperation,	and	the	night	manager	saw	it.“Look,	I’ll	set	you	up	with	some	rollaway	beds	in	the	conference	room,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“There’s	a	bathroom	down	there,	but	you	have	to	be	out	early	because	we	have	a
conference	starting	at	9	a.m.”
Grateful,	we	bedded	down	in	that	conference	room	with	its	industrial	carpet	and
fluorescent	lights,	our	own	personal	purgatory."
Book 2,"We	were	on	the	run	and	on	the
ropes,	but	my	mother	hadn’t	folded."
Book 2,"She	laid	back	and	stared	at	the	ceiling	tiles
until	we	nodded	off."
Book 2,"Then	she	slipped	into	an	adjacent	coffee	shop	to	keep	an
anxious	eye	on	our	bikes,	and	on	the	road,	all	night	long."
Book 2,"We	were	waiting	outside	that	Volvo	dealership	when	the	garage	opened	up,
which	gave	the	mechanics	just	enough	time	to	source	the	part	we	needed	and	get
us	back	on	the	road	before	their	day	was	done."
Book 2,"We	left	Erie	at	sunset	and	drove
all	night,	arriving	at	my	grandparents’	house	in	Brazil,	Indiana,	eight	hours	later."
Book 2,"My	mom	wept	as	she	parked	next	to	their	old	wooden	house	before	dawn,	and	I
understood	why."
Book 2,"Our	arrival	felt	significant,	then	and	now."
Book 2,"I	was	still	only	eight	years	old,	but
already	in	a	second	phase	of	life."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	what	awaited	me—what	awaited
us—in	that	small,	rural,	Southern	Indiana	town,	and	I	didn’t	much	care."
Book 2,"All	I
knew	was	that	we’d	escaped	from	Hell,	and	for	the	first	time	in	my	life,	we	were
free	from	the	Devil	himself."
Book 2,"***
We	stayed	with	my	grandparents	for	the	next	six	months,	and	I	enrolled	in
second	grade—for	the	second	time—at	a	local	Catholic	school	called
Annunciation."
Book 2,"I	was	the	only	eight-year-old	in	second	grade,	but	none	of	the
other	kids	knew	I	was	repeating	a	year,	and	there	was	no	doubt	that	I	needed	it."
Book 2,"I
could	barely	read,	but	I	was	lucky	enough	to	have	Sister	Katherine	as	my
teacher."
Book 2,"Short	and	petite,	Sister	Katherine	was	sixty	years	old	and	had	one	gold
front	tooth."
Book 2,She	was	a	nun	but	didn’t	wear	the	habit.
Book 2,"She	was	also	grumpy	as	hell
and	took	no	shit,	and	I	loved	her	thug	ass.Second	grade	in	Brazil
Annunciation	was	a	small	school."
Book 2,"Sister	Katherine	taught	all	of	first	and	second
grade	in	a	single	classroom,	and	with	only	eighteen	kids	to	teach,	she	wasn’t
willing	to	shirk	her	responsibility	and	blame	my	academic	struggles,	or
anybody’s	bad	behavior,	on	learning	disabilities	or	emotional	problems."
Book 2,"She
didn’t	know	my	backstory	and	didn’t	have	to."
Book 2,"All	that	mattered	to	her	was	that	I
turned	up	at	her	door	with	a	kindergarten	education,	and	it	was	her	job	to	shape
my	mind."
Book 2,"She	had	every	excuse	in	the	world	to	farm	me	out	to	some	specialist	or
label	me	a	problem,	but	that	wasn’t	her	style."
Book 2,"She	started	teaching	before
labeling	kids	was	a	normal	thing	to	do,	and	she	embodied	the	no-excuses
mentality	that	I	needed	if	I	was	going	to	catch	up."
Book 2,Sister	Katherine	is	the	reason	why	I’ll	never	trust	a	smile	or	judge	a	scowl.
Book 2,"My
dad	smiled	a	hell	of	a	lot,	and	he	didn’t	give	two	shits	about	me,	but	grouchy
Sister	Katherine	cared	about	us,	cared	about	me."
Book 2,She	wanted	us	to	be	our	verybest.
Book 2,"I	know	this	because	she	proved	it	by	spending	extra	time	with	me,	as	much
time	as	it	took,	until	I	retained	my	lessons."
Book 2,"Before	the	year	was	out,	I	could	read
at	a	second	grade	level."
Book 2,Trunnis	Jr.	hadn’t	adjusted	nearly	as	well.
Book 2,"Within	a	few
months	he	was	back	in	Buffalo,	shadowing	my	father	and	working	that
Skateland	detail	like	he’d	never	left."
Book 2,"By	then,	we’d	moved	into	a	place	of	our	own:	a	600-square-foot,	two-bedroom
apartment	at	Lamplight	Manor,	a	public	housing	block,	that	cost	us	$7	a	month."
Book 2,"My	father,	who	earned	thousands	every	night,	sporadically	sent	$25	every	three
or	four	weeks	(if	that)	for	child	support,	while	my	mother	earned	a	few	hundred
dollars	a	month	with	her	department	store	job."
Book 2,"In	her	off-hours	she	was	taking
courses	at	Indiana	State	University,	which	cost	money	too."
Book 2,"The	point	is,	we	had
gaps	to	fill,	so	my	mother	enrolled	in	welfare	and	received	$123	a	month	and
food	stamps."
Book 2,"They	wrote	her	a	check	for	the	first	month,	but	when	they	found
out	she	owned	a	car	they	disqualified	her,	explaining	that	if	she	sold	her	car
they’d	be	happy	to	help."
Book 2,"The	problem	is	we	lived	in	a	rural	town	with	a	population	of	about	8,000	that
didn’t	have	a	mass	transit	system."
Book 2,"We	needed	that	car	so	I	could	get	to	school,
and	so	she	could	get	to	work	and	take	night	classes."
Book 2,"She	was	hell-bent	on
changing	her	life	circumstances	and	found	a	workaround	through	the	Aide	to
Dependent	Children	program."
Book 2,"She	arranged	for	our	check	to	go	to	my
grandmother	who	signed	it	over	to	her,	but	that	didn’t	make	life	easy."
Book 2,"How	far
can	$123	really	go?"
Book 2,"I	vividly	recall	one	night	we	were	so	broke	we	drove	home	on	a	gas	tank	that
was	near	empty,	to	a	bare	refrigerator	and	a	past	due	electric	bill,	with	no	money
in	the	bank."
Book 2,"Then	I	remembered	that	we	had	two	mason	jars	filled	with	pennies
and	other	loose	change."
Book 2,I	grabbed	them	off	the	shelf.
Book 2,"“Mom,	let’s	count	our	change!”
She	smiled."
Book 2,"Growing	up,	her	father	had	taught	her	to	pick	up	the	change	she
found	on	the	street."
Book 2,"He	was	molded	by	the	Great	Depression	and	knew	what	it
was	like	to	be	down	and	out."
Book 2,"“You	never	know	when	you	might	need	it,”	he’d
say."
Book 2,"When	we	lived	in	Hell,	carrying	home	thousands	of	dollars	every	night,	the
notion	that	we	would	ever	run	out	of	money	sounded	ludicrous,	but	my	mother
retained	her	childhood	habit."
Book 2,"Trunnis	used	to	belittle	her	for	it,	but	now	it	wastime	to	see	how	far	found	money	could	take	us."
Book 2,"We	dumped	that	change	out	on	the	living	room	floor	and	counted	out	enough	to
cover	the	electric	bill,	fill	the	gas	tank,	and	buy	groceries."
Book 2,"We	even	had	enough
to	buy	burgers	at	Hardee’s	on	the	way	home."
Book 2,"These	were	dark	times,	but	we
were	managing."
Book 2,Barely.
Book 2,"My	mother	missed	Trunnis	Jr.	terribly,	but	she	was
pleased	that	I	was	adjusting	and	making	friends."
Book 2,"I’d	had	a	good	year	at	school,
and	from	our	first	night	in	Indiana	I	hadn’t	wet	the	bed	once."
Book 2,"It	seemed	that	I
was	healing,	but	my	demons	weren’t	gone."
Book 2,They	were	dormant.
Book 2,"And	when	they
came	back,	they	hit	hard."
Book 2,"***
Third	grade	was	a	shock	to	my	system."
Book 2,"Not	just	because	we	had	to	learn	cursive
when	I	was	still	getting	the	hang	of	reading	block	letters,	but	because	our
teacher,	Ms.	D,	was	nothing	like	Sister	Katherine."
Book 2,"Our	class	was	still	small,	we
had	about	twenty	kids	total,	split	between	third	and	fourth	grade,	but	she	didn’t
handle	it	nearly	as	well	and	wasn’t	interested	in	taking	the	extra	time	I	required."
Book 2,"My	trouble	started	with	the	standardized	test	we	took	during	our	first	couple	of
weeks	of	class."
Book 2,Mine	came	back	a	mess.
Book 2,"I	was	still	way	behind	the	other	kids	and
I	had	trouble	building	on	lessons	from	the	previous	days,	let	alone	the	previous
academic	year."
Book 2,"Sister	Katherine	considered	similar	signs	as	cues	to	dedicate
more	time	with	her	weakest	student,	and	she	challenged	me	daily."
Book 2,"Ms.	D	looked
for	a	way	out."
Book 2,"Within	the	first	month	of	class,	she	told	my	mother	that	I	belonged
in	a	different	school."
Book 2,"One	for	“special	students.”
Every	kid	knows	what	“special”	means."
Book 2,"It	means	you	are	about	to	be	stigmatized
for	the	rest	of	your	damn	life."
Book 2,It	means	that	you	are	not	normal.
Book 2,"The	threat	alone
was	a	trigger,	and	I	developed	a	stutter	almost	overnight."
Book 2,"My	thought-to-speech
flow	was	jammed	up	with	stress	and	anxiety,	and	it	was	at	its	worst	in	school."
Book 2,"Imagine	being	the	only	black	kid	in	class,	in	the	entire	school,	and	enduring	the
daily	humiliation	of	also	being	the	dumbest."
Book 2,"I	felt	like	everything	I	tried	to	do	or
say	was	wrong,	and	it	got	so	bad	that	instead	of	responding	and	skipping	like
scratched	vinyl	whenever	the	teacher	called	my	name,	I	often	chose	to	keep
quiet."
Book 2,It	was	all	about	limiting	exposure	to	save	face.Ms.	D	didn’t	even	attempt	to	empathize.
Book 2,"She	went	straight	to	frustration	and
vented	it	by	yelling	at	me,	sometimes	when	she	was	leaning	down,	her	hand	on
the	back	of	my	chair,	her	face	just	inches	from	my	own."
Book 2,"She	had	no	idea	the
Pandora’s	box	she	was	tearing	open."
Book 2,"Once,	school	was	a	safe	harbor,	the	one
place	I	knew	I	couldn’t	be	hurt,	but	in	Indiana	it	morphed	into	my	torture
chamber."
Book 2,"Ms.	D	wanted	me	out	of	her	classroom,	and	the	administration	supported	her
until	my	mother	fought	for	me."
Book 2,"The	principal	agreed	to	keep	me	enrolled	if	my
mother	signed	off	on	time	with	a	speech	therapist	and	put	me	into	group	therapy
with	a	local	shrink	they	recommended."
Book 2,"The	psychologist’s	office	was	adjacent	to	a	hospital,	which	was	exactly	where
you’d	want	to	put	it	if	you	were	trying	to	make	a	little	kid	doubt	himself."
Book 2,"It	was
like	a	bad	movie."
Book 2,"The	shrink	set	up	seven	chairs	in	a	semicircle	around	him,	but
some	of	the	kids	wouldn’t	or	couldn’t	sit	still."
Book 2,"One	child	wore	a	helmet	and
banged	his	head	against	the	wall	repeatedly."
Book 2,"Another	kid	stood	up	while	the
doctor	was	mid-sentence,	walked	toward	a	far	corner	of	the	room,	and	pissed	in
the	trash	can."
Book 2,"The	kid	sitting	next	to	me	was	the	most	normal	person	in	the
group,	and	he	had	set	his	own	house	on	fire!	I	can	remember	staring	up	at	the
shrink	on	my	first	day,	thinking,	There’s	no	way	I	belong	here."
Book 2,That	experience	kicked	my	social	anxiety	up	several	notches.
Book 2,"My	stutter	was	out
of	control."
Book 2,"My	hair	started	falling	out,	and	white	splotches	bloomed	on	my	dark
skin."
Book 2,"The	doctor	diagnosed	me	as	an	ADHD	case	and	prescribed	Ritalin,	but	my
problems	were	more	complex."
Book 2,I	was	suffering	from	toxic	stress.
Book 2,"The	type	of	physical	and	emotional	abuse	I	was	exposed	to	has	been	proven	to
have	a	range	of	side	effects	on	young	children	because	in	our	early	years	the
brain	grows	and	develops	so	rapidly."
Book 2,"If,	during	those	years,	your	father	is	an	evil
motherfucker	hell-bent	on	destroying	everyone	in	his	house,	stress	spikes,	and
when	those	spikes	occur	frequently	enough,	you	can	draw	a	line	across	the
peaks."
Book 2,That’s	your	new	baseline.
Book 2,"It	puts	kids	in	a	permanent	“fight	or	flight”
mode."
Book 2,"Fight	or	flight	can	be	a	great	tool	when	you’re	in	danger	because	it	amps
you	up	to	battle	through	or	sprint	from	trouble,	but	it’s	no	way	to	live.I’m	not	the	type	of	guy	to	try	to	explain	everything	with	science,	but	facts	are
facts."
Book 2,"I’ve	read	that	some	pediatricians	believe	toxic	stress	does	more	damage	to
kids	than	polio	or	meningitis."
Book 2,"I	know	firsthand	that	it	leads	to	learning
disabilities	and	social	anxiety	because	according	to	doctors	it	limits	language
development	and	memory,	which	makes	it	difficult	for	even	the	most	gifted
student	to	recall	what	they	have	already	learned."
Book 2,"Looking	at	the	long	game,
when	kids	like	me	grow	up,	they	face	an	increased	risk	for	clinical	depression,
heart	disease,	obesity,	and	cancer,	not	to	mention	smoking,	alcoholism,	and	drug
abuse."
Book 2,"Those	raised	in	abusive	households	have	an	increased	probability	of	being
arrested	as	a	juvenile	by	53	percent."
Book 2,"Their	odds	of	committing	a	violent	crime	as
an	adult	are	increased	by	38	percent."
Book 2,"I	was	the	poster	child	of	that	generic	term
we’ve	all	heard	before:	“at-risk	youth.”	My	mother	wasn’t	the	one	raising	a	thug."
Book 2,"Look	at	the	numbers	and	it’s	clear:	if	anyone	put	me	on	a	destructive	path	it	was
Trunnis	Goggins."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	stay	in	group	therapy	for	long,	and	I	didn’t	take	Ritalin	either."
Book 2,"My	mom
picked	me	up	after	my	second	session	and	I	sat	in	the	front	seat	of	her	car
wearing	a	thousand-yard	stare."
Book 2,"“Mom,	I’m	not	going	back,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“These	boys
are	crazy.”	She	agreed."
Book 2,"But	I	was	still	a	damaged	kid,	and	while	there	are	proven	interventions	on	the
best	way	to	teach	and	manage	kids	who	suffer	from	toxic	stress,	it’s	fair	to	say
that	Ms.	D	didn’t	get	those	memos."
Book 2,I	can’t	blame	her	for	her	own	ignorance.
Book 2,"The
science	wasn’t	nearly	as	clear	in	the	1980s	as	it	is	now."
Book 2,"All	I	know	is,	Sister
Katherine	toiled	in	the	trenches	with	the	same	malformed	kid	that	Ms.	D	dealt
with,	but	she	maintained	high	expectations	and	didn’t	let	her	frustration
overwhelm	her."
Book 2,"She	had	the	mindset	of,	Look,	everybody	learns	in	a	different
way	and	we’re	gonna	figure	out	how	you	learn."
Book 2,"She	deduced	that	I	needed
repetition."
Book 2,"That	I	needed	to	solve	the	same	problems	over	and	over	again	in	a
different	way	to	learn,	and	she	knew	that	took	time."
Book 2,"Ms.	D	was	all	about
productivity."
Book 2,"She	was	saying,	Keep	up	or	get	out."
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	I	felt	backed	into	a
corner."
Book 2,"I	knew	that	if	I	didn’t	show	some	improvement	I	would	eventually	be
shipped	out	to	that	special	black	hole	for	good,	so	I	found	a	solution."
Book 2,I	started	cheating	my	ass	off.
Book 2,"Studying	was	hard,	especially	with	my	fucked-up	brain,	but	I	was	a	damn	good
cheat."
Book 2,"I	copied	friends’	homework	and	scanned	my	neighbors’	work	during	tests.I	even	copied	the	answers	on	the	standardized	tests	that	didn’t	have	any	impact
on	my	grades."
Book 2,"It	worked!	My	rising	test	scores	placated	Ms.	D,	and	my	mother
stopped	getting	calls	from	school."
Book 2,"I	thought	I’d	solved	a	problem	when	really	I
was	creating	new	ones	by	taking	the	path	of	least	resistance."
Book 2,"My	coping
mechanism	confirmed	that	I	would	never	learn	squat	at	school,	and	that	I	would
never	catch	up,	which	pushed	me	closer	toward	a	flunked	out	fate."
Book 2,"The	saving	grace	of	those	early	years	in	Brazil	was	that	I	was	way	too	young	to
understand	the	kind	of	prejudice	I	would	soon	face	in	my	new	hick	hometown."
Book 2,"Whenever	you’re	the	only	one	of	your	kind,	you’re	in	danger	of	being	pushed
toward	the	margins,	suspected	and	disregarded,	bullied	and	mistreated	by
ignorant	people."
Book 2,"That’s	just	the	way	life	is,	especially	back	then,	and	by	the	time
that	reality	kicked	me	in	the	throat,	my	life	had	already	become	a	full-fledged,
fuck-you	fortune	cookie."
Book 2,"Whenever	I	cracked	it	open,	I	got	the	same	message."
Book 2,"You	were	born	to	fail!CHALLENGE	#1
My	bad	cards	arrived	early	and	stuck	around	a	while,	but	everyone	gets
challenged	in	life	at	some	point."
Book 2,What	was	your	bad	hand?
Book 2,"What	kind	of	bullshit
did	you	contend	with	growing	up?"
Book 2,Were	you	beaten?
Book 2,Abused?
Book 2,Bullied?
Book 2,"Did	you
ever	feel	insecure?"
Book 2,"Maybe	your	limiting	factor	is	that	you	grew	up	so	supported
and	comfortable,	you	never	pushed	yourself?"
Book 2,What	are	the	current	factors	limiting	your	growth	and	success?
Book 2,"Is	someone
standing	in	your	way	at	work	or	school?"
Book 2,"Are	you	underappreciated	and
overlooked	for	opportunities?"
Book 2,"What	are	the	long	odds	you’re	up	against	right
now?"
Book 2,Are	you	standing	in	your	own	way?
Book 2,"Break	out	your	journal—if	you	don’t	have	one,	buy	one,	or	start	one	on	your
laptop,	tablet,	or	in	the	notes	app	on	your	smart	phone—and	write	them	all	out	in

Book 2,Don’t	be	bland	with	this	assignment.
Book 2,"I	showed	you	every	piece	of
my	dirty	laundry."
Book 2,"If	you	were	hurt	or	are	still	in	harm’s	way,	tell	the	story	in	full."

Book 2,"You	will	use	your	story,	this	list	of	excuses,	these	very	good	reasons	why	you
shouldn’t	amount	to	a	damn	thing,	to	fuel	your	ultimate	success."
Book 2,"Sounds	fun
right?"
Book 2,"Yeah,	it	won’t	be."
Book 2,But	don’t	worry	about	that	yet.
Book 2,We’ll	get	there.
Book 2,"For
now,	just	take	inventory."
Book 2,"Once	you	have	your	list,	share	it	with	whoever	you	want."
Book 2,"For	some,	it	may	mean

soul."

but	this	act	alone	will	begin	to	empower	you	to	overcome.CHAPTER	TWO
2."
Book 2,"TRUTH	HURTS
Wilmoth	Irving	was	a	new	beginning."
Book 2,"Up	until	he	met	my	mother	and	asked	for
her	phone	number,	all	I’d	known	was	misery	and	struggle."
Book 2,"When	the	money	was
good,	our	lives	were	defined	by	trauma."
Book 2,"Once	we	were	free	of	my	father,	we
were	swept	under	by	our	own	PTSD-level	dysfunction	and	poverty."
Book 2,"Then,	when
I	was	in	fourth	grade,	she	met	Wilmoth,	a	successful	carpenter	and	general
contractor	from	Indianapolis."
Book 2,"She	was	attracted	to	his	easy	smile	and	laid-back
style."
Book 2,There	was	no	violence	in	him.
Book 2,He	gave	us	permission	to	exhale.
Book 2,"With	him
around	it	felt	like	we	had	some	support,	like	something	good	was	finally
happening	to	us.With	Wilmoth
She	laughed	when	they	were	together."
Book 2,Her	smile	was	bright	and	real.
Book 2,"She	stood
up	a	little	straighter."
Book 2,He	gave	her	pride	and	made	her	feel	beautiful	again.
Book 2,"As	for
me,	Wilmoth	became	as	close	to	a	healthy	father	figure	as	I’ve	ever	had."
Book 2,"He
didn’t	coddle	me."
Book 2,"He	didn’t	tell	me	he	loved	me	or	any	of	that	fake-ass	sappy
shit,	but	he	was	there."
Book 2,"Basketball	had	been	an	obsession	of	mine	since	grade
school."
Book 2,"It	was	the	core	of	my	relationship	with	my	best	friend,	Johnny	Nichols,
and	Wilmoth	had	game."
Book 2,He	and	I	hit	the	courts	together	all	the	time.
Book 2,"He	showed
me	moves,	tuned	up	my	defensive	discipline,	and	helped	me	develop	a	jump
shot."
Book 2,"The	three	of	us	celebrated	birthdays	and	holidays	together,	and	the	summer
before	eighth	grade,	he	got	down	on	one	knee	and	asked	my	mother	to	make	it
official."
Book 2,"Wilmoth	lived	in	Indianapolis,	and	our	plan	was	to	move	in	with	him	the
following	summer."
Book 2,"Though	he	wasn’t	nearly	as	rich	as	Trunnis,	he	made	a	nice
living	and	we	looked	forward	to	city	life	again."
Book 2,"Then	in	1989,	the	day	after
Christmas,	everything	stopped."
Book 2,"We	hadn’t	made	the	full	time	move	to	Indy	yet,	and	he’d	spent	Christmas	Day
with	us	at	my	grandparents’	place	in	Brazil."
Book 2,"The	next	day,	he	had	a	basketball
game	in	his	men’s	league	and	he’d	invited	me	to	sub	for	one	of	his	teammates."
Book 2,"I
was	so	excited	I’d	packed	my	bags	two	days	early,	but	that	morning	he	told	me	I
couldn’t	come	after	all."
Book 2,"“I’m	gonna	keep	you	back	here	this	time,	Little	David,”	he	said."
Book 2,"I	dropped	my
head	and	sighed."
Book 2,He	could	tell	I	was	upset	and	tried	to	reassure	me.
Book 2,"“Your	mom
is	gonna	drive	up	in	a	few	days	and	we	can	play	ball	then.”
I	nodded,	reluctantly,	but	I	wasn’t	raised	to	pry	into	the	affairs	of	adults	and
knew	I	wasn’t	owed	an	explanation	or	make-up	game."
Book 2,"My	mother	and	I	watched
from	the	front	porch	as	he	backed	out	of	the	carport,	smiled,	and	gave	us	that
crisp	single	wave	of	his."
Book 2,Then	he	drove	off.
Book 2,It	was	the	last	time	we’d	ever	see	him	alive.
Book 2,"He	played	in	his	men’s	league	game	that	night,	as	planned,	and	drove	home
alone	to	the	“house	with	the	white	lions.”	Whenever	he	gave	directions	tofriends,	family,	or	delivery	guys,	that’s	how	he	always	described	his	ranch-style
house,	its	driveway	framed	by	two	white	lion	sculptures	elevated	on	pillars."
Book 2,"He
pulled	between	them	and	into	the	garage	where	he	could	enter	the	house	directly,
oblivious	to	the	danger	moving	in	from	behind."
Book 2,"He	never	did	close	that	garage
door."
Book 2,"They’d	been	staking	him	out	for	hours,	waiting	for	a	window,	and	as	he	climbed
out	from	the	driver’s	side	door,	they	stepped	from	the	shadows	and	fired	from
close	range."
Book 2,He	was	shot	five	times	in	the	chest.
Book 2,"When	he	dropped	to	the	floor	of
his	garage,	the	gunman	stepped	over	him	and	delivered	a	kill	shot	right	between
his	eyes."
Book 2,"Wilmoth’s	father	lived	a	few	blocks	away,	and	when	he	drove	by	the	white	lions
the	next	morning,	he	noticed	his	son’s	garage	door	open	and	knew	something
was	wrong."
Book 2,"He	walked	up	the	driveway	and	into	the	garage	where	he	sobbed
over	his	dead	son."
Book 2,Wilmoth	was	just	forty-three	years	old.
Book 2,"I	was	still	at	my	grandmother’s	house	when	Wilmoth’s	mother	called	moments
later."
Book 2,She	hung	up	and	motioned	me	to	her	side	to	break	the	news.
Book 2,"I	thought
about	my	mom."
Book 2,Wilmoth	had	been	her	savior.
Book 2,"She’d	been	coming	out	of	her
shell,	opening	up,	ready	to	believe	in	good	things."
Book 2,What	would	this	do	to	her?
Book 2,Would	God	ever	give	her	a	damn	break?
Book 2,"It	started	as	a	simmer	but	within
seconds	my	rage	overwhelmed	me."
Book 2,"I	broke	free	of	my	grandmother,	punched	the
refrigerator,	and	left	a	dent."
Book 2,"We	drove	to	our	place	to	find	my	mother,	who	was	already	frantic	because	she
hadn’t	heard	from	Wilmoth."
Book 2,"She	called	his	house	just	before	we	arrived,	and
when	a	detective	picked	up	the	phone	it	puzzled	her,	but	she	didn’t	expect	this."
Book 2,How	could	she?
Book 2,"We	saw	her	confusion	as	my	grandmother	walked	over,	peeled
the	phone	from	her	fingers,	and	sat	her	down."
Book 2,She	didn’t	believe	us	at	first.
Book 2,"Wilmoth	was	a	prankster	and	this	was	just	the	kind
of	fucked-up	stunt	he	might	try	to	pull	off."
Book 2,"Then	she	remembered	he’d	been	shot
two	months	before."
Book 2,He’d	told	her	the	guys	who’d	done	that	weren’t	after	him.
Book 2,"That	those	bullets	were	meant	for	someone	else,	and	because	they	merely	grazed
him,	she	decided	to	forget	about	the	whole	thing."
Book 2,"Until	that	moment,	she	neversuspected	that	Wilmoth	had	some	secret	street	life	she	knew	nothing	about,	and
the	police	never	did	find	out	exactly	why	he	was	shot	and	killed."
Book 2,"The	speculation
was	that	he	was	involved	in	a	shady	business	deal	or	a	drug	deal	gone	bad."
Book 2,"My
mother	was	still	in	denial	when	she	packed	a	bag,	but	she	included	a	dress	for	his
funeral."
Book 2,"When	we	arrived,	his	house	was	wrapped	in	a	ribbon	of	yellow	police	tape	like	a
fucked-up	Christmas	gift."
Book 2,This	was	no	prank.
Book 2,"My	mom	parked,	ducked	under	the
tape,	and	I	followed	right	behind	her	to	the	front	door."
Book 2,"On	the	way,	I	remember
glancing	to	my	left	trying	to	get	a	glimpse	of	the	scene	where	Wilmoth	had	been
killed."
Book 2,His	cold	blood	was	still	pooled	on	the	garage	floor.
Book 2,"I	was	a	fourteen-year-
old	wandering	through	an	active	crime	scene,	but	nobody,	not	my	mother,	not
Wilmoth’s	family,	and	not	even	the	police	seemed	disturbed	by	me	being	there,
absorbing	the	heavy	vibe	of	my	would-be	stepfather’s	murder."
Book 2,"As	fucked	up	as	it	sounds,	the	police	allowed	my	mom	to	stay	in	Wilmoth’s
house	that	night."
Book 2,"Rather	than	stay	alone,	she	had	her	brother-in-law	there,	armed
with	his	two	guns	in	case	the	killers	came	back."
Book 2,"I	wound	up	in	a	back	bedroom	at
Wilmoth’s	sister’s	place,	a	dark	and	spooky	house	a	few	miles	away,	and	left
alone	all	night."
Book 2,"The	house	was	furnished	with	one	of	those	analog,	cabinet
television	sets	with	thirteen	channels	on	a	dial."
Book 2,"Only	three	channels	came	in
static-free,	and	I	kept	it	on	the	local	news."
Book 2,"They	ran	the	same	tape	on	a	loop
every	thirty	minutes:	footage	of	my	mom	and	me	ducking	under	police	tape	then
watching	Wilmoth	get	wheeled	on	a	gurney	toward	a	waiting	ambulance,	a	sheet
over	his	body."
Book 2,It	was	like	a	horror	scene.
Book 2,"I	sat	there	all	alone,	watching	the	same	footage	over
and	over."
Book 2,My	mind	was	a	broken	record	that	kept	skipping	into	darkness.
Book 2,"The
past	had	been	bleak	and	now	our	sky-blue	future	had	been	blown	the	fuck	up
too."
Book 2,"There	would	be	no	reprieve,	only	my	familiar	fucked-up	reality	choking	out
all	light."
Book 2,"Each	time	I	watched,	my	fear	grew	until	it	filled	the	room,	and	still	I
could	not	stop."
Book 2,"A	few	days	after	we	buried	Wilmoth,	and	just	after	the	new	year,	I	boarded	a
school	bus	in	Brazil,	Indiana."
Book 2,"I	was	still	grieving,	and	my	head	was	spinning
because	my	mother	and	I	hadn’t	decided	whether	or	not	we	were	staying	in
Brazil	or	moving	to	Indianapolis	as	planned."
Book 2,"We	were	in	limbo	and	she	remained
in	a	state	of	shock."
Book 2,She	still	hadn’t	cried	over	Wilmoth’s	death.
Book 2,Instead	shebecame	emotionally	vacant	again.
Book 2,"It	was	as	if	all	the	pain	she’d	experienced	in
her	life	resurfaced	as	one	gaping	wound	she	disappeared	into,	and	there	was	no
reaching	her	in	that	void."
Book 2,"In	the	meantime,	school	was	starting	up,	so	I	played
along,	looking	for	any	shred	of	normal	I	could	hang	onto."
Book 2,But	it	was	hard.
Book 2,"I	rode	a	bus	to	school	most	days,	and	my	first	day	back,	I
couldn’t	shake	a	memory	I’d	buried	from	the	year	before."
Book 2,"That	morning,	I	slid
into	a	seat	above	the	back	left	tire	overlooking	the	street	as	usual."
Book 2,"When	we
arrived	at	school	the	bus	pulled	up	to	the	curb,	we	needed	to	wait	for	the	ones
ahead	of	us	to	move	before	we	could	get	off."
Book 2,"In	the	meantime,	a	car	pulled
alongside	us,	and	a	cute,	overeager	little	boy	ran	toward	our	bus	carrying	a
platter	of	cookies."
Book 2,The	driver	didn’t	see	him.
Book 2,The	bus	jerked	forward.
Book 2,"I	noticed	the	alarmed	look	on	his	mother’s	face	before	the	sudden	crush	of	blood
splattered	my	window."
Book 2,His	mother	howled	in	horror.
Book 2,"She	wasn’t	among	us
anymore."
Book 2,"She	looked	and	sounded	like	a	fierce,	wounded	animal	as	she	literally
pulled	the	hair	from	her	head	by	the	roots."
Book 2,"Soon	sirens	wailed	in	the	distance	and
screamed	closer	by	the	second."
Book 2,The	little	boy	was	about	six	years	old.
Book 2,"The
cookies	were	a	present	for	the	driver."
Book 2,"We	were	all	ordered	off	the	bus,	and	as	I	walked	by	the	tragedy,	for	some	reason
—call	it	human	curiosity,	call	it	the	magnetic	pull	of	dark	to	dark—I	peeked
under	the	bus	and	saw	him."
Book 2,"His	head	was	nearly	as	flat	as	paper,	his	brains	and
blood	mingled	under	the	carriage	like	spent	oil."
Book 2,"For	a	full	year	I	hadn’t	thought	of	that	image	even	once,	but	Wilmoth’s	death
reawakened	it,	and	now	it	was	all	I	could	think	about."
Book 2,I	was	beyond	the	pale.
Book 2,Nothing	mattered	to	me.
Book 2,"I’d	seen	enough	to	know	that	the	world	was	filled	with
human	tragedy	and	that	it	would	just	keep	piling	up	in	drifts	until	it	swallowed
me."
Book 2,I	couldn’t	sleep	in	bed	anymore.
Book 2,Neither	could	my	mother.
Book 2,"She	slept	in	her	arm
chair	with	the	television	on	blast	or	with	a	book	in	her	hands."
Book 2,"For	a	little	while,	I
tried	to	curl	up	in	bed	at	night	but	would	always	wake	in	the	fetal	position	on	the
floor."
Book 2,Eventually	I	gave	in	and	bedded	down	low	to	the	ground.
Book 2,"Maybe	because	I
knew	if	I	could	find	comfort	at	the	bottom	place	there	would	be	no	more	falling."
Book 2,"We	were	two	people	in	dire	need	of	the	fresh	start	we	thought	we	had	coming,	soeven	without	Wilmoth,	we	made	the	move	to	Indianapolis."
Book 2,"My	mother	set	me	up
for	entry	exams	at	Cathedral	High	School,	a	private	college	preparatory	academy
in	the	heart	of	the	city."
Book 2,"As	usual,	I	cheated,	and	off	a	smart	motherfucker	too."
Book 2,"When	my	acceptance	letter	and	class	schedule	came	in	the	mail	the	summer
before	freshman	year,	I	was	looking	at	a	full	slate	of	AP	classes!
I	hacked	my	way	through,	cheating	and	copying,	and	managed	to	make	the
freshman	basketball	team,	which	was	one	of	the	best	freshman	teams	in	the
entire	state."
Book 2,"We	had	several	future	college	players,	and	I	started	at	point	guard."
Book 2,"That	was	a	confidence	boost,	but	not	the	kind	I	could	build	on	because	I	knew	I
was	an	academic	fraud."
Book 2,"Plus,	the	school	cost	my	mom	way	too	much	money,	so
after	only	one	year	at	Cathedral,	she	pulled	the	plug."
Book 2,"I	started	my	sophomore	year	at	North	Central	High	School,	a	public	school	with
4,000	kids	in	a	majority	black	neighborhood,	and	on	my	first	day	I	turned	up	like
some	preppy-ass	white	boy."
Book 2,"My	jeans	were	definitely	too	tight,	and	my	collared
shirt	was	tucked	into	a	waistline	cinched	with	a	braided	belt."
Book 2,"The	only	reason	I
didn’t	get	completely	laughed	out	of	the	building	was	because	I	could	ball."
Book 2,My	sophomore	year	was	all	about	being	cool.
Book 2,"I	switched	up	my	wardrobe,	which
was	increasingly	influenced	by	hip	hop	culture,	and	hung	out	with	gang	bangers
and	other	borderline	delinquents,	which	meant	I	didn’t	always	go	to	school."
Book 2,"One
day,	my	mom	came	home	in	the	middle	of	the	day	and	found	me	sitting	around
our	dining	room	table	with	what	she	described	as	“ten	thugs.”	She	wasn’t	wrong."
Book 2,"Within	a	few	weeks	she	packed	us	up	and	moved	us	back	to	Brazil,	Indiana."
Book 2,"I	enrolled	at	Northview	High	School	the	week	of	basketball	tryouts,	and	I
remember	showing	up	at	lunch	time	when	the	cafeteria	was	full."
Book 2,"There	were
1,200	kids	enrolled	at	Northview,	only	five	of	which	were	black,	and	the	last
time	any	of	them	had	seen	me	I	looked	a	lot	like	them."
Book 2,Not	anymore.
Book 2,"I	strolled	into	school	that	day	wearing	pants	five	sizes	too	big	and	sagged	way
down	low."
Book 2,"I	also	wore	an	oversized	Chicago	Bulls	Jacket	with	a	backward	hat,
cocked	to	the	side."
Book 2,"Within	seconds,	all	eyes	were	upon	me."
Book 2,"Teachers,	students,
and	administrative	staff	stared	at	me	like	I	was	some	exotic	species."
Book 2,"I	was	the
first	thuggish	black	kid	many	of	them	had	seen	in	real	life."
Book 2,"My	mere	presence
had	stopped	the	music."
Book 2,"I	was	the	needle	being	dragged	across	vinyl,	scratching	a
whole	new	rhythm,	and	like	hip	hop	itself,	everybody	noticed	but	not	everyoneliked	what	they	heard."
Book 2,I	strutted	through	the	scene	like	I	gave	no	fucks.
Book 2,But	that	was	a	lie.
Book 2,"I	acted	all	kinds	of	cocky	and	my	entrance	was	brash	as	hell,
but	I	felt	very	insecure	going	back	there."
Book 2,"Buffalo	had	been	like	living	in	a
blazing	inferno."
Book 2,"My	early	years	in	Brazil	were	a	perfect	incubator	for	post
traumatic	stress,	and	before	I	left	I	was	delivered	a	double	dose	of	death	trauma."
Book 2,"Moving	to	Indianapolis	had	been	an	opportunity	to	escape	pity	and	leave	all	that
behind."
Book 2,"Class	wasn’t	easy	for	me,	but	I’d	made	friends	and	developed	a	new
style."
Book 2,"Now,	coming	back,	I	looked	different	enough	on	the	outside	to	perpetuate
an	illusion	that	I’d	changed,	but	in	order	to	change	you	have	to	work	through
shit."
Book 2,Confront	it	and	get	real.
Book 2,I	hadn’t	done	a	shred	of	that	hard	work.
Book 2,"I	was	still	a
dumb	kid	with	nothing	solid	to	lean	on,	and	basketball	tryouts	ripped	away	any
confidence	I	had	left."
Book 2,"When	I	got	to	the	gym,	they	made	me	suit-up	in	uniform	rather	than	wear	my
more	generic	gym	clothes."
Book 2,"Back	then	the	style	was	getting	baggy	and	oversized,
which	Chris	Webber	and	Jalen	Rose	of	the	Fab	Five	would	make	famous	at	the
University	of	Michigan."
Book 2,"The	coaches	in	Brazil	didn’t	have	their	fingers	on	that
pulse."
Book 2,"They	put	me	in	the	tighty-whitey	version	of	basketball	shorts,	which
strangled	my	balls,	hugged	my	thighs	super	tight,	and	felt	all	kinds	of	wrong."
Book 2,"I
was	trapped	in	the	coaches’	preferred	dream	state:	a	Larry	Bird	time	warp."
Book 2,"Which	made	sense	because	Larry	Legend	was	basically	a	patron	saint	in	Brazil
and	all	of	Indiana."
Book 2,"In	fact,	his	daughter	went	to	our	school."
Book 2,We	were	friends.
Book 2,"But
that	didn’t	mean	I	wanted	to	dress	like	him!
Then	there	was	my	etiquette."
Book 2,"In	Indianapolis	the	coaches	let	us	talk	shit	on	the
court."
Book 2,"If	I	made	a	good	move	or	hit	a	shot	in	your	face,	I	talked	about	your	mama
or	your	girlfriend."
Book 2,"In	Indy,	I’d	done	research	on	my	shit	talking."
Book 2,I	got	good	at	it.
Book 2,"I	was	the	Draymond	Green	of	my	school,	and	it	was	all	part	of	basketball	culture
in	the	city."
Book 2,"Back	in	farm	country,	that	cost	me."
Book 2,"When	tryouts	started,	I	handled
the	rock	a	bunch,	and	when	I	crossed	some	of	the	kids	over	and	made	them	look
bad	I	let	them	and	the	coaches	know."
Book 2,"My	attitude	embarrassed	the	coaches	(who
were	apparently	ignorant	that	their	hero,	Larry	Legend,	was	an	all-time	great
trash	talker),	and	it	wasn’t	long	before	they	took	the	ball	out	of	my	hands	and	put
me	in	the	front	court,	a	position	I’d	never	played	before."
Book 2,"I	was	uncomfortable
down	low,	and	played	like	it."
Book 2,That	shut	me	up	good.
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	Johnny	was
dominating.My	only	saving	grace	that	week	was	getting	back	with	Johnny	Nichols."
Book 2,"We’d
stayed	close	while	I	was	away	and	our	marathon	one-on-one	battles	were	back
on	full	swing."
Book 2,"Though	he	was	undersized,	he	was	always	a	nice	player	and	he
was	one	of	the	best	on	the	floor	during	tryouts."
Book 2,"He	was	draining	shots,	seeing	the
open	man,	and	running	the	court."
Book 2,"It	was	no	surprise	when	he	made	the	varsity
squad,	but	we	were	both	shocked	that	I	barely	made	JV."
Book 2,I	was	crushed.
Book 2,And	not	because	of	basketball	tryouts.
Book 2,"To	me	that	outcome	was
another	symptom	of	something	else	I’d	been	feeling."
Book 2,"Brazil	looked	the	same,	but
shit	felt	different	this	time	around."
Book 2,"Grade	school	had	been	hard	academically,	but
even	though	we	were	one	of	only	a	few	black	families	in	town,	I	didn’t	notice	or
feel	any	palpable	racism."
Book 2,"As	a	teenager	I	experienced	it	everywhere,	and	it
wasn’t	because	I’d	become	ultra	sensitive."
Book 2,"Outright	racism	had	always	been
there."
Book 2,"Not	long	after	moving	back	to	Brazil,	my	cousin	Damien	and	I	went	to	a	party
way	out	in	the	country."
Book 2,We	stayed	out	well	past	curfew.
Book 2,"In	fact,	we	were	up	all
night	long,	and	after	daybreak	we	called	our	grandmother	for	a	ride	home."
Book 2,“Excuse	me?”	She	asked.
Book 2,"“You	disobeyed	me,	so	you	may	as	well	start
walking.”
Roger	that."
Book 2,"She	lived	ten	miles	away,	down	a	long	country	road,	but	we	joked	around	and
enjoyed	ourselves	as	we	started	to	stroll."
Book 2,"Damien	lived	in	Indianapolis	and	we
were	both	sagging	our	baggy	jeans	and	dressed	in	oversized	Starter	jackets,	not
exactly	typical	gear	on	Brazil’s	country	roads."
Book 2,"We’d	walked	seven	miles	in	a	few
hours	when	a	pick-up	truck	came	bouncing	down	the	tarmac	in	our	direction."
Book 2,"We
edged	to	the	side	of	the	road	to	let	it	pass,	but	it	slowed	down,	and	as	it	crept	past
us,	we	could	see	two	teenagers	in	the	cab	and	a	third	standing	in	the	bed	of	the
truck."
Book 2,The	passenger	pointed	and	yelled	through	his	open	window.
Book 2,"“Niggers!”
We	didn’t	overreact."
Book 2,"We	put	our	heads	down	and	kept	walking	at	the	same	pace,
until	we	heard	that	beat-to-shit	truck	squeal	to	a	stop	on	a	patch	of	gravel,	and
kick	up	a	dust	storm."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	turned	and	saw	the	passenger,	a	scruffylooking	redneck,	exit	the	cab	of	the	truck	with	a	pistol	in	his	hand."
Book 2,"He	aimed	it	at
my	head	as	he	stalked	toward	me."
Book 2,"“Where	the	fuck	you	from,	and	why	the	fuck	you	here	in	this	fucking	town?!”
Damien	eased	down	the	road,	while	I	locked	eyes	with	the	gunman	and	said
nothing."
Book 2,He	stepped	within	two	feet	of	me.
Book 2,"The	threat	of	violence	doesn’t	get
much	more	real	than	that."
Book 2,"Chills	rippled	my	skin,	but	I	refused	to	run	or	cower."
Book 2,After	a	few	seconds	he	got	back	in	the	truck	and	they	sped	off.
Book 2,It	wasn’t	the	first	time	I’d	heard	the	word.
Book 2,"Not	long	before	that	I	was	hanging
out	in	Pizza	Hut	with	Johnny	and	a	couple	of	girls,	including	a	brunette	I	liked,
named	Pam."
Book 2,"She	liked	me	too,	but	we’d	never	acted	on	it."
Book 2,"We	were	two
innocents	enjoying	one	another’s	company,	but	when	her	father	arrived	to	take
her	home	he	caught	sight	of	us,	and	when	Pam	saw	him,	her	face	went	ghost
white."
Book 2,He	burst	into	the	packed	restaurant	and	stalked	toward	us	with	all	eyes	on	him.
Book 2,He	never	addressed	me.
Book 2,"He	just	locked	eyes	with	her	and	said,	“I	don’t	want	to
ever	see	you	sitting	with	this	nigger	again.”
She	hustled	out	the	door	after	him,	her	face	red	with	shame	as	I	sat,	paralyzed,
staring	at	the	floor."
Book 2,"It	was	the	most	humiliating	moment	of	my	life,	and	it	hurt
much	more	than	the	gun	incident	because	it	happened	in	public,	and	the	word
had	been	spewed	by	a	grown-ass	man."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	understand	how	or	why	he	was
filled	with	so	much	hate,	and	if	he	felt	that	way,	how	many	other	people	in
Brazil	shared	his	point	of	view	when	they	saw	me	walking	down	the	street?"
Book 2,"It
was	the	sort	of	riddle	you	didn’t	want	to	solve."
Book 2,"***
They	won’t	call	on	me	if	they	can’t	see	me."
Book 2,"That	was	how	I	operated	during	my
sophomore	year	in	high	school	in	Brazil,	Indiana."
Book 2,"I	would	hide	out	in	the	back
rows,	slump	low	in	my	chair,	and	sidestep	my	way	through	each	and	every	class."
Book 2,"Our	high	school	made	us	take	a	foreign	language	that	year,	which	was	funny	to
me."
Book 2,"Not	because	I	couldn’t	see	the	value,	but	because	I	could	barely	read
English,	let	alone	understand	Spanish."
Book 2,"By	then,	after	a	good	eight	years	of
cheating,	my	ignorance	had	crystalized."
Book 2,"I	kept	leveling	up	in	school,	on	track,but	hadn’t	learned	a	damn	thing."
Book 2,"I	was	one	of	those	kids	who	thought	he	was
gaming	the	system	when,	the	whole	time,	I’d	been	gaming	myself."
Book 2,"One	morning,	about	halfway	through	the	school	year,	I	milled	into	Spanish	class
and	grabbed	my	workbook	from	a	back	cupboard."
Book 2,"There	was	technique	involved
in	skating	by."
Book 2,"You	didn’t	have	to	pay	attention,	but	you	did	have	to	make	it	seem
like	you	were,	so	I	slumped	into	my	seat,	opened	up	my	workbook,	and	fixed	my
gaze	on	the	teacher	who	lectured	from	the	front	of	the	room."
Book 2,When	I	looked	down	at	the	page	the	whole	room	went	silent.
Book 2,At	least	to	me.
Book 2,"Her
lips	were	still	moving,	but	I	couldn’t	hear	because	my	attention	had	narrowed	on
the	message	left	for	me,	and	me	alone."
Book 2,"We	each	had	our	own	assigned	workbook	in	that	class,	and	my	name	was	written
in	pencil	at	the	top	right	corner	of	the	title	page."
Book 2,"That’s	how	they	knew	it	was
mine."
Book 2,"Below	that,	someone	had	drawn	an	image	of	me	in	a	noose."
Book 2,"It	looked
rudimentary,	like	something	out	of	the	hangman	game	we	used	to	play	as	kids."
Book 2,Below	that	were	the	words.
Book 2,"Niger	we’re	gonna	kill	you!
They’d	misspelled	it,	but	I	had	no	clue."
Book 2,"I	could	barely	spell	myself,	and	they’d
made	their	fucking	point."
Book 2,"I	looked	around	the	room	as	my	rage	gathered	like	a
typhoon	until	it	was	literally	buzzing	in	my	ears."
Book 2,"I’m	not	supposed	to	be	here,	I
thought	to	myself."
Book 2,"I’m	not	supposed	to	be	back	in	Brazil!
I	took	inventory	of	all	the	incidents	I’d	already	experienced	and	decided	I
couldn’t	take	much	more."
Book 2,"The	teacher	was	still	talking	when	I	rose	up	without
warning."
Book 2,She	called	my	name	but	I	wasn’t	trying	to	hear.
Book 2,"I	left	the	classroom,
notebook	in	hand,	and	bolted	to	the	principal’s	office."
Book 2,"I	was	so	enraged	I	didn’t
even	stop	at	the	front	desk."
Book 2,"I	walked	right	into	his	office	and	dropped	the
evidence	on	his	desk."
Book 2,"“I’m	tired	of	this	shit,”	I	said."
Book 2,"Kirk	Freeman	was	the	principal	at	that	time,	and	to	this	day	he	still	remembers
looking	up	from	his	desk	and	seeing	tears	in	my	eyes."
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	some	mystery
why	all	this	shit	was	happening	in	Brazil."
Book 2,"Southern	Indiana	had	always	been	ahotbed	of	racists,	and	he	knew	it."
Book 2,"Four	years	later,	in	1995,	the	Ku	Klux	Klan
would	march	down	Brazil’s	main	drag	on	Independence	Day,	in	full	hooded
regalia."
Book 2,"The	KKK	was	active	in	Center	Point,	a	town	located	not	fifteen	minutes
away,	and	kids	from	there	went	to	our	school."
Book 2,"Some	of	them	sat	behind	me	in
history	class	and	told	racist	jokes	for	my	benefit	nearly	every	damn	day."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t
expecting	some	investigation	into	who	did	it."
Book 2,"More	than	anything,	in	that
moment,	I	was	looking	for	some	compassion,	and	I	could	tell	from	the	look	in
Principal	Freeman’s	eyes	he	felt	bad	about	what	I	was	going	through,	but	he	was
at	a	loss."
Book 2,He	didn’t	know	how	to	help	me.
Book 2,"Instead,	he	examined	the	drawing	and
the	message	for	a	long	beat,	then	raised	his	eyes	to	mine,	ready	to	console	me
with	his	words	of	wisdom."
Book 2,"“David,	this	is	sheer	ignorance,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“They	don’t	even	know	how	to	spell
nigger.”
My	life	had	been	threatened,	and	that	was	the	best	he	could	do."
Book 2,"The	loneliness	I
felt	leaving	his	office	is	something	I’ll	never	forget."
Book 2,"It	was	scary	to	think	that
there	was	so	much	hate	flowing	through	the	halls	and	that	someone	I	didn’t	even
know	wanted	me	dead	because	of	the	color	of	my	skin."
Book 2,"The	same	question	kept
looping	through	my	mind:	Who	the	fuck	is	out	here	who	hates	me	like	this?"
Book 2,"I
had	no	idea	who	my	enemy	was."
Book 2,"Was	it	one	of	the	rednecks	from	history	class,
or	was	it	somebody	I	thought	I	was	cool	with	but	who	really	didn’t	like	me	at
all?"
Book 2,"It	was	one	thing	staring	down	the	barrel	of	a	gun	on	the	street	or	dealing
with	some	racist	parent."
Book 2,At	least	that	shit	was	honest.
Book 2,"Wondering	who	else	felt
that	way	in	my	school	was	a	different	kind	of	unnerving,	and	I	couldn’t	shake	it
off."
Book 2,"Even	though	I	had	plenty	of	friends,	all	of	them	white,	I	couldn’t	stop	seeing
the	hidden	racism	scrawled	all	over	the	walls	in	invisible	ink,	which	made	it
extremely	hard	to	carry	the	weight	of	being	the	only.KKK	in	Center	Point	in	1995—Center	Point	is	fifteen	minutes	from	my	house	in	Brazil
Most,	if	not	all,	minorities,	women,	and	gay	people	in	America	know	that	strain
of	loneliness	well."
Book 2,"Of	walking	into	rooms	where	you	are	the	only	one	of	your
kind."
Book 2,Most	white	men	have	no	idea	how	hard	it	can	be.
Book 2,I	wish	they	did.
Book 2,"Because
then	they’d	know	how	it	drains	you."
Book 2,"How	some	days,	all	you	want	to	do	is	stay
home	and	wallow	because	to	go	public	is	to	be	completely	exposed,	vulnerable
to	a	world	that	tracks	and	judges	you."
Book 2,At	least	that’s	how	it	feels.
Book 2,"The	truth	is,
you	can’t	tell	for	sure	when	or	if	that	is	actually	happening	in	a	given	moment."
Book 2,"But	it	often	feels	like	it,	which	is	its	own	kind	of	mindfuck."
Book 2,"In	Brazil,	I	was	the
only	everywhere	I	went."
Book 2,"At	my	table	in	the	cafeteria,	where	I	chilled	at	lunch
with	Johnny	and	our	crew."
Book 2,In	every	class	I	took.
Book 2,"Even	in	the	damn	basketball
gym."
Book 2,"By	the	end	of	that	year	I	turned	sixteen	and	my	grandfather	bought	me	a	used,
doo-doo	brown	Chevy	Citation."
Book 2,"One	of	the	first	mornings	I	ever	drove	it	to
school,	someone	spray	painted	the	word	“nigger”	on	my	driver’s	side	door."
Book 2,"This
time	they	spelled	it	correctly	and	Principal	Freeman	was	again	at	a	loss	for
words."
Book 2,"The	fury	that	churned	within	me	that	day	was	indescribable,	but	it	didn’t
radiate	out."
Book 2,"It	broke	me	down	from	within	because	I	hadn’t	yet	learned	what	to
do	or	where	to	channel	that	much	emotion."
Book 2,Was	I	supposed	to	fight	everybody?
Book 2,"I’d	been	suspended	from	school	three	times
for	fighting,	and	by	now	I	was	almost	numb."
Book 2,"Instead,	I	withdrew	and	fell	into	the
well	of	black	nationalism."
Book 2,Malcolm	X	became	my	prophet	of	choice.
Book 2,"I	used	to
come	home	from	school	and	watch	the	same	video	of	one	of	his	early	speeches
every	damn	day."
Book 2,"I	was	trying	to	find	comfort	somewhere,	and	the	way	he
analyzed	history	and	spun	black	hopelessness	into	rage	nourished	me,	though
most	of	his	political	and	economic	philosophies	went	over	my	head."
Book 2,"It	was	his
anger	at	a	system	made	by	and	for	white	people	that	I	connected	with	because	I
lived	in	a	haze	of	hate,	trapped	in	my	own	fruitless	rage	and	ignorance."
Book 2,"But	I
wasn’t	Nation	of	Islam	material."
Book 2,"That	shit	took	discipline,	and	I	had	none	of	that."
Book 2,"Instead,	by	my	junior	year,	I	went	out	of	my	way	to	piss	people	off	by	becoming
the	exact	stereotype	racist	white	people	loathed	and	feared."
Book 2,"I	wore	my	pants
down	below	my	ass	every	day."
Book 2,"I	ghetto	wired	my	car	stereo	to	house	speakers
which	filled	the	trunk	of	my	Citation."
Book 2,I	rattled	windows	when	I	cruised	downBrazil’s	main	drag	blasting	Snoop’s	Gin	and	Juice.
Book 2,"I	put	three	of	those	shag
carpet	covers	over	my	steering	wheel	and	dangled	a	pair	of	fuzzy	dice	from	the
rearview."
Book 2,"Every	morning	before	school	I	stared	into	our	bathroom	mirror	and
came	up	with	new	ways	to	fuck	with	the	racists	at	my	school."
Book 2,I	even	concocted	wild	hairdos.
Book 2,"Once,	I	gave	myself	a	reverse	part—shaving
away	all	my	hair	save	a	thin	radial	line	on	the	left	side	of	my	scalp."
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	that
I	was	unpopular."
Book 2,"I	was	considered	the	cool	black	kid	in	town,	but	if	you’d	have
bothered	to	drill	down	a	little	deeper,	you’d	see	that	I	wasn’t	about	black	culture
and	that	my	antics	weren’t	really	trying	to	call	out	racism."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	about
anything	at	all."
Book 2,"Everything	I	did	was	to	get	a	reaction	out	of	the	people	who	hated	me	most
because	everyone’s	opinion	of	me	mattered	to	me,	and	that’s	a	shallow	way	to
live."
Book 2,"I	was	full	of	pain,	had	no	real	purpose,	and	if	you	were	watching	from	afar
it	would	have	looked	like	I’d	given	up	on	any	chance	of	success."
Book 2,"That	I	was
heading	for	disaster."
Book 2,But	I	hadn’t	let	go	of	all	hope.
Book 2,I	had	one	more	dream	left.
Book 2,I	wanted	to	join	the	Air	Force.
Book 2,"My	grandfather	had	been	a	cook	in	the	Air	Force	for	thirty-seven	years,	and	he
was	so	proud	of	his	service	that	even	after	he	retired	he’d	wear	his	dress	uniform
to	church	on	Sundays,	and	his	work-a-day	uniform	midweek	just	to	sit	on	the
damn	porch."
Book 2,"That	level	of	pride	inspired	me	to	join	the	Civil	Air	Patrol,	the
civilian	auxiliary	of	the	Air	Force."
Book 2,"We	met	once	a	week,	marched	in	formation,
and	learned	about	the	various	jobs	available	in	the	Air	Force	from	officers,
which	is	how	I	became	fascinated	with	Pararescue—the	guys	who	jump	out	of
airplanes	to	pull	downed	pilots	out	of	harm’s	way."
Book 2,"I	attended	a	week-long	course	during	the	summer	before	my	freshman	year
called	PJOC,	the	Pararescue	Jump	Orientation	Course."
Book 2,"As	usual,	I	was	the	only."
Book 2,"One	day	a	pararescuman	named	Scott	Gearen	came	to	speak,	and	he	had	a
motherfucker	of	a	story	to	tell."
Book 2,"During	a	standard	exercise,	on	a	high	altitude
jump	from	13,000	feet,	Gearen	deployed	his	chute	with	another	skydiver	right
above	him."
Book 2,That	wasn’t	out	of	the	ordinary.
Book 2,"He	had	the	right	of	way,	and	per	his
training,	he’d	waved	off	the	other	jumper."
Book 2,"Except	the	guy	didn’t	see	him,	which
placed	Gearen	in	grave	danger	because	the	jumper	above	him	was	still	mid	free-
fall,	hurtling	through	the	air	at	over	120	mph."
Book 2,"He	went	into	a	cannonball	hopingto	avoid	clipping	Gearen,	but	it	didn’t	work."
Book 2,"Gearen	had	no	clue	what	was
coming	when	his	teammate	flew	through	his	canopy,	collapsing	it	on	contact,
and	slammed	into	Gearen’s	face	with	his	knees."
Book 2,"Gearen	was	knocked
unconscious	instantly	and	wobbled	into	another	free	fall,	his	crushed	chute
creating	very	little	drag."
Book 2,"The	other	skydiver	was	able	to	deploy	his	chute	and
survive	with	minor	injuries."
Book 2,Gearen	didn’t	really	land.
Book 2,"He	bounced	like	a	flat	basketball,	three	times,	but
because	he’d	been	unconscious,	his	body	was	limp,	and	he	didn’t	come	apart
despite	crashing	into	the	ground	at	100	mph."
Book 2,"He	died	twice	on	the	operating
table,	but	the	ER	docs	brought	him	back	to	life."
Book 2,"When	he	woke	in	a	hospital	bed,
they	said	he	wouldn’t	make	a	full	recovery	and	would	never	be	a	pararescuman
again."
Book 2,"Eighteen	months	later	he’d	defied	medical	odds,	made	that	full	recovery,
and	was	back	on	the	job	he	loved.For	years	I	was	obsessed	with	that	story	because	he’d	survived	the	impossible,
and	I	resonated	with	his	survival."
Book 2,"After	Wilmoth’s	murder,	with	all	those	racist
taunts	raining	down	on	my	head	(I	won’t	bore	you	with	every	single	episode,
just	know	there	were	many	more),	I	felt	like	I	was	free	falling	with	no	fucking
chute."
Book 2,"Gearen	was	living	proof	that	it’s	possible	to	transcend	anything	that
doesn’t	kill	you,	and	from	the	time	I	heard	him	speak	I	knew	I	would	enlist	in
the	Air	Force	after	graduation,	which	only	made	school	seem	more	irrelevant."
Book 2,Especially	after	I	was	cut	from	the	varsity	basketball	team	during	my	junior	year.
Book 2,I	wasn’t	cut	because	of	my	skills.
Book 2,"The	coaches	knew	I	was	one	of	the	best
players	they	had,	and	that	I	loved	the	game."
Book 2,"Johnny	and	I	played	it	night	and
day."
Book 2,"Our	entire	friendship	was	based	on	basketball,	but	because	I	was	angry	at
the	coaches	for	how	they	used	me	on	the	JV	team	the	year	before,	I	didn’t	attend
summer	workouts,	and	they	took	that	as	a	lack	of	commitment	to	the	team."
Book 2,"They
didn’t	know	or	care	that	when	they	cut	me,	they’d	eliminated	any	incentive	I’d
had	to	keep	my	GPA	up,	which	I’d	barely	managed	to	do	through	cheating
anyway."
Book 2,"Now,	I	had	no	good	reason	to	attend	school."
Book 2,"At	least	that’s	what	I
thought,	because	I	was	clueless	about	the	emphasis	that	the	military	places	on
education."
Book 2,I	figured	they’d	take	anybody.
Book 2,"Two	incidents	convinced	me	otherwise
and	inspired	me	to	change."
Book 2,"The	first	was	when	I	failed	the	Armed	Services	Vocational	Aptitude	Battery	test
(ASVAB)	during	my	junior	year."
Book 2,"The	ASVAB	is	the	armed	forces	version	of	the
SATs.	It’s	a	standardized	test	that	allows	the	military	to	assess	your	current
knowledge	and	future	potential	for	learning	at	the	same	time,	and	I	showed	up
for	that	test	prepared	to	do	what	I	did	best:	cheat."
Book 2,"I’d	been	copying	on	every	test,
in	every	class,	for	years,	but	when	I	took	my	seat	for	the	ASVAB	I	was	shocked
to	see	that	the	people	seated	to	my	right	and	left	had	different	tests	than	I	did."
Book 2,"I
had	to	go	it	alone	and	scored	a	20	out	of	a	possible	99	points."
Book 2,"The	absolute
minimum	standard	to	be	admitted	to	the	Air	Force	is	only	36,	and	I	couldn’t
even	get	there."
Book 2,"The	second	sign	that	I	needed	to	change	arrived	with	a	postmark	just	before
school	let	out	for	the	summer	after	junior	year."
Book 2,"My	mother	was	still	in	her
emotional	black	hole	after	Wilmoth’s	murder,	and	her	coping	mechanism	was	to
take	on	as	much	as	possible."
Book 2,"She	worked	full-time	at	DePauw	University	and
taught	night	classes	at	Indiana	State	University	because	if	she	stopped	hustling
long	enough	to	think,	she	would	realize	the	reality	of	her	life."
Book 2,"She	kept	itmoving,	was	never	around,	and	never	asked	to	see	my	grades."
Book 2,"After	the	first
semester	of	our	junior	year,	I	remember	Johnny	and	me	bringing	home	Fs	and
Ds.	We	spent	two	hours	doctoring	the	ink."
Book 2,"We	turned	Fs	into	Bs	and	Ds	into	Cs,
and	were	laughing	the	whole	damn	time."
Book 2,"I	actually	remember	feeling	a	perverse
pride	in	being	able	to	show	my	fake	grades	to	my	mother,	but	she	never	even
asked	to	see	them."
Book 2,She	took	my	damn	word	for	it.
Book 2,"Junior	year	transcript
We	lived	parallel	lives	in	the	same	house,	and	since	I	was	more	or	less	raising
myself,	I	stopped	listening	to	her."
Book 2,"In	fact,	about	ten	days	before	the	letter	arrived,
she’d	kicked	me	out	because	I	refused	to	come	home	from	a	party	before	curfew."
Book 2,"She	told	me	that	if	I	didn’t,	I	shouldn’t	come	home	at	all."
Book 2,"In	my	mind,	I	had	already	been	living	by	myself	for	several	years."
Book 2,"I	made	my
own	meals,	cleaned	my	own	clothes."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	angry	at	her.
Book 2,"I	was	cocky	and
figured	I	didn’t	need	her	anymore."
Book 2,"I	stayed	out	that	night,	and	for	the	next	weekand	a	half	I	crashed	at	Johnny’s	place	or	with	other	friends."
Book 2,"Eventually	the	day
came	when	I’d	spent	my	last	dollar."
Book 2,"By	chance,	she	called	me	at	Johnny’s	that
morning	and	told	me	about	a	letter	from	school."
Book 2,"It	said	I’d	missed	over	a	quarter
of	the	year	due	to	unexcused	absences,	that	I	had	a	D	average,	and	unless	I
showed	significant	improvement	in	my	GPA	and	attendance	during	my	senior
year,	I	would	not	graduate."
Book 2,She	wasn’t	emotional	about	it.
Book 2,"She	was	more
exhausted	than	exasperated."
Book 2,"“I’ll	come	home	and	get	the	note,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“No	need	for	that,”	she	replied,	“I	just	wanted	you	to	know	you	were	flunking
out.”
I	showed	up	on	her	doorstep	later	that	day	with	my	stomach	growling."
Book 2,"I	didn’t
ask	for	forgiveness	and	she	didn’t	demand	an	apology."
Book 2,"She	just	left	the	door
open	and	walked	away."
Book 2,"I	stepped	into	the	kitchen	and	made	myself	a	peanut
butter	and	jelly	sandwich."
Book 2,She	passed	me	the	letter	without	saying	a	word.
Book 2,"I	read
it	in	my	room	where	the	walls	were	papered	over	with	layers	of	Michael	Jordan
and	special	ops	posters."
Book 2,"Inspiration	for	twin	passions	slipping	through	my
fingers."
Book 2,"That	night,	after	taking	a	shower,	I	wiped	the	steam	away	from	our	corroded
bathroom	mirror	and	took	a	good	look."
Book 2,I	didn’t	like	who	I	saw	staring	back.
Book 2,"I
was	a	low-budget	thug	with	no	purpose	and	no	future."
Book 2,"I	felt	so	disgusted	I
wanted	to	punch	that	motherfucker	in	the	face	and	shatter	glass."
Book 2,"Instead,	I
lectured	him."
Book 2,It	was	time	to	get	real.
Book 2,"“Look	at	you,”	I	said."
Book 2,“Why	do	you	think	the	Air	Force	wants	your	punk	ass?
Book 2,You	stand	for	nothing.
Book 2,"You	are	an	embarrassment.”
I	reached	for	the	shaving	cream,	smoothed	a	thin	coat	over	my	face,	unwrapped
a	fresh	razor	and	kept	talking	as	I	shaved."
Book 2,“You	are	one	dumb	motherfucker.
Book 2,You	read	like	a	third	grader.
Book 2,"You’re	a	fucking
joke!	You’ve	never	tried	hard	at	anything	in	your	life	besides	basketball,	and	you
have	goals?"
Book 2,"That’s	fucking	hilarious.”
After	shaving	peach	fuzz	from	my	cheeks	and	chin,	I	lathered	up	my	scalp."
Book 2,I	wasdesperate	for	a	change.
Book 2,I	wanted	to	become	someone	new.
Book 2,“You	don’t	see	people	in	the	military	sagging	their	pants.
Book 2,"You	need	to	stop
talking	like	a	wanna-be-gangster."
Book 2,"None	of	this	shit	is	gonna	cut	it!	No	more
taking	the	easy	way	out!	It’s	time	to	grow	the	fuck	up!”
Steam	billowed	all	around	me."
Book 2,It	rippled	off	my	skin	and	poured	from	my	soul.
Book 2,What	started	as	a	spontaneous	venting	session	had	become	a	solo	intervention.
Book 2,"“It’s	on	you,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“Yeah,	I	know	shit	is	fucked	up."
Book 2,"I	know	what	you’ve	been
through."
Book 2,"I	was	there,	bitch!	Merry	fucking	Christmas."
Book 2,"Nobody	is	coming	to	save
your	ass!	Not	your	mommy,	not	Wilmoth."
Book 2,"Nobody!	It’s	up	to	you!”
By	the	time	I	was	done	talking,	I	was	shaved	clean."
Book 2,"Water	pearled	on	my	scalp,
streamed	from	my	forehead,	and	dripped	down	the	bridge	of	my	nose."
Book 2,"I	looked
different,	and	for	the	first	time,	I’d	held	myself	accountable."
Book 2,"A	new	ritual	was
born,	one	that	stayed	with	me	for	years."
Book 2,"It	would	help	me	get	my	grades	up,
whip	my	sorry	ass	into	shape,	and	see	me	through	graduation	and	into	the	Air
Force."
Book 2,The	ritual	was	simple.
Book 2,"I’d	shave	my	face	and	scalp	every	night,	get	loud,	and	get
real."
Book 2,"I	set	goals,	wrote	them	on	Post-It	notes,	and	tagged	them	to	what	I	now	call
the	Accountability	Mirror,	because	each	day	I’d	hold	myself	accountable	to	the
goals	I’d	set."
Book 2,"At	first	my	goals	involved	shaping	up	my	appearance	and
accomplishing	all	my	chores	without	having	to	be	asked."
Book 2,"Make	your	bed	like	you’re	in	the	military	every	day!
Pull	up	your	pants!
Shave	your	head	every	morning!
Cut	the	grass!
Wash	all	dishes!
The	Accountability	Mirror	kept	me	on	point	from	then	on,	and	though	I	was	still
young	when	this	strategy	came	through	me,	since	then	I’ve	found	it	useful	for
people	at	any	stage	in	life."
Book 2,"You	could	be	on	the	cusp	of	retirement,	looking	toreinvent	yourself."
Book 2,"Maybe	you’re	going	through	a	bad	break-up	or	have	gained
weight."
Book 2,"Perhaps	you’re	permanently	disabled,	overcoming	some	other	injury,	or
are	just	coming	to	grips	with	how	much	of	your	life	you’ve	wasted,	living
without	purpose."
Book 2,"In	each	case,	that	negativity	you’re	feeling	is	your	internal
desire	for	change,	but	change	doesn’t	come	easy,	and	the	reason	this	ritual
worked	so	well	for	me	was	because	of	my	tone."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	fluffy.
Book 2,I	was	raw	because	that	was	the	only	way	to	get	myself	right.
Book 2,"That
summer	between	my	junior	and	senior	year	in	high	school	I	was	afraid."
Book 2,"I	was
insecure."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	a	smart	kid.
Book 2,"I’d	blown	off	all	accountability	for	my	entire
teenage	existence,	and	actually	thought	I	was	getting	over	on	all	the	adults	in	my
life,	getting	over	on	the	system."
Book 2,"I’d	duped	myself	into	a	negative	feedback	loop
of	cheating	and	scamming	that	on	the	surface	looked	like	advancement	until	I	hit
a	brick	fucking	wall	called	reality."
Book 2,"That	night	when	I	came	home	and	read	the
letter	from	my	school,	there	was	no	denying	the	truth,	and	I	delivered	it	hard."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	dance	around	and	say,	“Geez,	David,	you	are	not	taking	your	education
very	seriously.”	No,	I	had	to	own	it	in	the	raw	because	the	only	way	we	can
change	is	to	be	real	with	ourselves."
Book 2,"If	you	don’t	know	shit	and	have	never	taken
school	seriously,	then	say,	“I’m	dumb!”	Tell	yourself	that	you	need	to	get	your
ass	to	work	because	you’re	falling	behind	in	life!
If	you	look	in	the	mirror	and	you	see	a	fat	person,	don’t	tell	yourself	that	you
need	to	lose	a	couple	of	pounds."
Book 2,Tell	the	truth.
Book 2,You’re	fucking	fat!	It’s	okay.
Book 2,"Just
say	you’re	fat	if	you’re	fat."
Book 2,"The	dirty	mirror	that	you	see	every	day	is	going	to
tell	you	the	truth	every	time,	so	why	are	you	still	lying	to	yourself?"
Book 2,"So	you	can
feel	better	for	a	few	minutes	and	stay	the	fucking	same?"
Book 2,"If	you’re	fat	you	need	to
change	the	fact	that	you’re	fat	because	it’s	very	fucking	unhealthy."
Book 2,"I	know
because	I’ve	been	there."
Book 2,"If	you	have	worked	for	thirty	years	doing	the	same	shit	you’ve	hated	day	in	and
day	out	because	you	were	afraid	to	quit	and	take	a	risk,	you’ve	been	living	like	a
pussy."
Book 2,"Period,	point	blank."
Book 2,"Tell	yourself	the	truth!	That	you’ve	wasted	enough
time,	and	that	you	have	other	dreams	that	will	take	courage	to	realize,	so	you
don’t	die	a	fucking	pussy."
Book 2,Call	yourself	out!Nobody	likes	to	hear	the	hard	truth.
Book 2,"Individually	and	as	a	culture,	we	avoid	what
we	need	to	hear	most."
Book 2,"This	world	is	fucked	up,	there	are	major	problems	in	our
society."
Book 2,"We	are	still	dividing	ourselves	up	along	racial	and	cultural	lines,	and
people	don’t	have	the	balls	to	hear	it!	The	truth	is	racism	and	bigotry	still
fucking	exist	and	some	people	are	so	thin-skinned	they	refuse	to	admit	that."
Book 2,"To
this	day,	many	in	Brazil	claim	that	there	is	no	racism	in	their	small	town."
Book 2,"That’s
why	I	have	to	give	Kirk	Freeman	props."
Book 2,"When	I	called	him	in	the	spring	of	2018,
he	remembered	what	I	went	through	very	clearly."
Book 2,"He’s	one	of	the	few	who	isn’t
afraid	of	the	truth."
Book 2,"But	if	you	are	the	only,	and	you	aren’t	stuck	in	some	real-world	genocidal
twilight	zone,	you’d	better	get	real	too."
Book 2,"Your	life	is	not	fucked	up	because	of
overt	racists	or	hidden	systemic	racism."
Book 2,"You	aren’t	missing	out	on	opportunities,
making	shit	money,	and	getting	evicted	because	of	America	or	Donald	fucking
Trump	or	because	your	ancestors	were	slaves	or	because	some	people	hate
immigrants	or	Jews	or	harass	women	or	believe	gay	people	are	going	to	hell."
Book 2,"If
any	of	that	shit	is	stopping	you	from	excelling	in	life,	I’ve	got	some	news."
Book 2,"You
are	stopping	you!
You	are	giving	up	instead	of	getting	hard!	Tell	the	truth	about	the	real	reasons
for	your	limitations	and	you	will	turn	that	negativity,	which	is	real,	into	jet	fuel."
Book 2,"Those	odds	stacked	against	you	will	become	a	damn	runway!
There	is	no	more	time	to	waste."
Book 2,"Hours	and	days	evaporate	like	creeks	in	the
desert."
Book 2,"That’s	why	it’s	okay	to	be	cruel	to	yourself	as	long	as	you	realize	you’re
doing	it	to	become	better."
Book 2,We	all	need	thicker	skin	to	improve	in	life.
Book 2,"Being	soft
when	you	look	in	the	mirror	isn’t	going	to	inspire	the	wholesale	changes	we
need	to	shift	our	present	and	open	up	our	future."
Book 2,"The	morning	after	that	first	session	with	the	Accountability	Mirror,	I	trashed	the
shag	steering	wheel	and	the	fuzzy	dice."
Book 2,"I	tucked	my	shirt	in	and	wore	my	pants
with	a	belt,	and,	once	school	started	up	again,	I	stopped	eating	at	my	lunch	table."
Book 2,"For	the	first	time,	being	liked	and	acting	cool	were	a	waste	of	my	time,	and
instead	of	eating	with	all	the	popular	kids,	I	found	my	own	table	and	ate	alone."
Book 2,"Mind	you,	the	rest	of	my	progress	could	not	be	described	as	a	blink-and-you’ll-
miss-it	metamorphosis."
Book 2,"Lady	Luck	did	not	suddenly	show	up,	run	me	a	hot
soapy	bath,	and	kiss	me	like	she	loved	me."
Book 2,"In	fact,	the	only	reason	I	didn’tbecome	just	another	statistic	is	because,	at	the	last	possible	moment,	I	got	to
work."
Book 2,"During	my	senior	year	in	high	school,	all	I	cared	about	was	working	out,	playing
basketball,	and	studying,	and	it	was	the	Accountability	Mirror	that	kept	me
motivated	to	keep	pushing	toward	something	better."
Book 2,"I	woke	up	before	dawn	and
started	going	to	the	YMCA	most	mornings	at	5	a.m.	before	school	to	hit	the
weights."
Book 2,"I	ran	all	the	damn	time,	usually	around	the	local	golf	course	after	dark."
Book 2,One	night	I	ran	thirteen	miles—the	most	I’d	ever	run	in	my	entire	life.
Book 2,"On	that
run	I	came	to	a	familiar	intersection."
Book 2,"It	was	the	same	street	where	that	redneck
had	pulled	a	gun	on	me."
Book 2,"I	avoided	it	and	ran	on,	covering	a	half	mile	in	the
opposite	direction	before	something	told	me	to	turn	back."
Book 2,"When	I	arrived	at	that
intersection	a	second	time,	I	stopped	and	contemplated	it."
Book 2,"I	was	scared	shitless	of
that	street,	my	heart	was	leaping	from	my	chest,	which	is	exactly	why	I	suddenly
started	charging	down	its	fucking	throat."
Book 2,"Within	seconds,	two	snarling	dogs	got	loose	and	chased	me	as	the	woods	leaned
in	on	both	sides."
Book 2,It	was	all	I	could	do	to	stay	a	step	ahead	of	the	beasts.
Book 2,"I	kept
expecting	that	truck	to	reappear	and	run	me	the	fuck	down,	like	some	scene	from
Mississippi	circa	1965,	but	I	kept	running,	faster	and	faster,	until	I	was
breathless."
Book 2,"Eventually	the	hounds	of	Hell	gave	up	and	loped	off,	and	it	was	just
me,	the	rhythm	and	steam	of	my	breath,	and	that	deep	country	quiet."
Book 2,"It	was
cleansing."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	turned	back,	my	fear	was	gone."
Book 2,"I	owned	that	fucking
street."
Book 2,"From	then	on,	I	brainwashed	myself	into	craving	discomfort."
Book 2,"If	it	was	raining,	I
would	go	run."
Book 2,"Whenever	it	started	snowing,	my	mind	would	say,	Get	your
fucking	running	shoes	on."
Book 2,"Sometimes	I	wussed	out	and	had	to	deal	with	it	at	the
Accountability	Mirror."
Book 2,"But	facing	that	mirror,	facing	myself,	motivated	me	to
fight	through	uncomfortable	experiences,	and,	as	a	result,	I	became	tougher."
Book 2,"And
being	tough	and	resilient	helped	me	meet	my	goals."
Book 2,Nothing	was	as	hard	for	me	as	learning.
Book 2,"The	kitchen	table	became	my	all-day,
all-night	study	hall."
Book 2,"After	I’d	failed	the	ASVAB	a	second	time,	my	mother
realized	that	I	was	serious	about	the	Air	Force,	so	she	found	me	a	tutor	who
helped	me	figure	out	a	system	I	could	use	to	learn."
Book 2,"That	system	was
memorization."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	learn	just	by	scratching	a	few	notes	and	memorizing
those."
Book 2,I	had	to	read	a	text	book	and	write	each	page	down	in	my	notebook.
Book 2,Thendo	it	again	a	second	and	third	time.
Book 2,"That’s	how	knowledge	stuck	to	the	mirror	of
my	mind."
Book 2,"Not	through	learning,	but	through	transcription,	memorization,	and
recall."
Book 2,I	did	that	for	English.
Book 2,I	did	that	for	history.
Book 2,"I	wrote	out	and	memorized	formulas
for	algebra."
Book 2,"If	my	tutor	took	an	hour	to	teach	me	a	lesson,	I	had	to	go	back	over
my	notes	from	that	session	for	six	hours	to	lock	it	in."
Book 2,"My	personal	study	hall
schedule	and	goals	became	Post-It	notes	on	my	Accountability	Mirror,	and	guess
what	happened?"
Book 2,I	developed	an	obsession	for	learning.
Book 2,"Over	six	months	I	went	from	having	a	fourth	grade	reading	level	to	that	of	a
senior	in	high	school."
Book 2,My	vocabulary	mushroomed.
Book 2,"I	wrote	out	thousands	of
flash	cards	and	went	over	them	for	hours,	days,	and	weeks."
Book 2,"I	did	the	same	for
mathematical	formulas."
Book 2,Part	of	it	was	survival	instinct.
Book 2,"I	damn	sure	wasn’t	going
to	get	into	college	based	on	academics,	and	though	I	was	a	starter	on	the	varsity
basketball	team	my	senior	year,	no	college	scouts	knew	my	name."
Book 2,"All	I	knew
was	that	I	had	to	get	the	fuck	out	of	Brazil,	Indiana;	that	the	military	was	my	best
chance;	and	to	get	there	I	had	to	pass	the	ASVAB."
Book 2,"On	my	third	try,	I	met	the
minimum	standard	for	the	Air	Force."
Book 2,Living	with	purpose	changed	everything	for	me—at	least	in	the	short	term.
Book 2,"During	my	senior	year	in	high	school,	studying	and	working	out	gave	my	mind
so	much	energy	that	hate	flaked	from	my	soul	like	used-up	snake	skin."
Book 2,"The
resentment	I	held	toward	the	racists	in	Brazil,	the	emotion	that	had	dominated
me	and	was	burning	me	up	inside,	dissipated	because	I’d	finally	considered	the
fucking	source."
Book 2,"I	looked	at	the	people	who	were	making	me	feel	uncomfortable	and	realized	how
uncomfortable	they	were	in	their	own	skin."
Book 2,"To	make	fun	of	or	try	to	intimidate
someone	they	didn’t	even	know	based	on	race	alone	was	a	clear	indication	that
something	was	very	wrong	with	them,	not	me."
Book 2,"But	when	you	have	no	confidence
it	becomes	easy	to	value	other	people’s	opinions,	and	I	was	valuing	everyone’s
opinion	without	considering	the	minds	that	generated	them."
Book 2,"That	sounds	silly,
but	it’s	an	easy	trap	to	fall	into,	especially	when	you	are	insecure	on	top	of	being
the	only."
Book 2,"As	soon	as	I	made	that	connection,	being	upset	with	them	was	not
worth	my	time."
Book 2,"Because	if	I	was	gonna	kick	their	ass	in	life,	and	I	was,	I	had
way	too	much	shit	to	do."
Book 2,"Each	insult	or	dismissive	gesture	became	more	fuel	for
the	engine	revving	inside	me.By	the	time	I	graduated,	I	knew	that	the	confidence	I’d	managed	to	develop
didn’t	come	from	a	perfect	family	or	God-given	talent."
Book 2,"It	came	from	personal
accountability	which	brought	me	self	respect,	and	self	respect	will	always	light	a
way	forward."
Book 2,"For	me,	it	lit	up	a	path	straight	out	of	Brazil,	forever."
Book 2,But	I	didn’t	get	away	clean.
Book 2,"When	you	transcend	a	place	in	time	that	has	challenged	you	to	the	core,	it	can
feel	like	you’ve	won	a	war."
Book 2,Don’t	fall	for	that	mirage.
Book 2,"Your	past,	your	deepest
fears,	have	a	way	of	going	dormant	before	springing	back	to	life	at	double
strength."
Book 2,You	must	remain	vigilant.
Book 2,"For	me,	the	Air	Force	revealed	that	I	was
still	soft	inside."
Book 2,I	was	still	insecure.
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	yet	hard	of	bone	and	mind.CHALLENGE	#2
It’s	time	to	come	eyeball	to	eyeball	with	yourself,	and	get	raw	and	real."
Book 2,"This	is
not	a	self-love	tactic."
Book 2,You	can’t	fluff	it.
Book 2,Don’t	massage	your	ego.
Book 2,"This	is	about
abolishing	the	ego	and	taking	the	first	step	toward	becoming	the	real	you!
I	tacked	Post-It	notes	on	my	Accountability	Mirror,	and	I’ll	ask	you	to	do	the
same."
Book 2,Digital	devices	won’t	work.
Book 2,"Write	all	your	insecurities,	dreams,	and	goals
on	Post-Its	and	tag	up	your	mirror."
Book 2,"If	you	need	more	education,	remind	yourself
that	you	need	to	start	working	your	ass	off	because	you	aren’t	smart	enough!
Period,	point	blank."
Book 2,"If	you	look	in	the	mirror	and	see	someone	who	is	obviously
overweight,	that	means	you’re	fucking	fat!	Own	it!	It’s	okay	to	be	unkind	with
yourself	in	these	moments	because	we	need	thicker	skin	to	improve	in	life."
Book 2,"Whether	it’s	a	career	goal	(quit	my	job,	start	a	business),	a	lifestyle	goal	(lose
weight,	get	more	active),	or	an	athletic	one	(run	my	first	5K,	10K,	or	marathon),
you	need	to	be	truthful	with	yourself	about	where	you	are	and	the	necessary
steps	it	will	take	to	achieve	those	goals,	day	by	day."
Book 2,"Each	step,	each	necessary
point	of	self-improvement,	should	be	written	as	its	own	note."
Book 2,"That	means	you
have	to	do	some	research	and	break	it	all	down."
Book 2,"For	example,	if	you	are	trying	to
lose	forty	pounds,	your	first	Post-It	may	be	to	lose	two	pounds	in	the	first	week."
Book 2,"Once	that	goal	is	achieved,	remove	the	note	and	post	the	next	goal	of	two	to	five
pounds	until	your	ultimate	goal	is	realized."
Book 2,"Whatever	your	goal,	you’ll	need	to	hold	yourself	accountable	for	the	small	steps
it	will	take	to	get	there."
Book 2,Self-improvement	takes	dedication	and	self-discipline.
Book 2,The	dirty	mirror	you	see	every	day	is	going	to	reveal	the	truth.
Book 2,Stop	ignoring	it.
Book 2,Use	it	to	your	advantage.
Book 2,"If	you	feel	it,	post	an	image	of	yourself	staring	into

Book 2,"THE	IMPOSSIBLE	TASK
It	was	past	midnight	and	the	streets	were	dead."
Book 2,"I	steered	my	pickup	truck	into
another	empty	parking	lot	and	killed	the	engine."
Book 2,"In	the	quiet	all	I	could	hear	were
the	eerie	halogen	hum	of	the	street	lamps	and	the	scratch	of	my	pen	as	I	checked
off	another	franchise	feed	trough."
Book 2,"The	latest	in	a	never-ending	series	of	fast	food
and	dine-in	industrial	kitchens	that	received	more	nightly	visitors	than	you’d
care	to	know	about."
Book 2,"That’s	why	guys	like	me	showed	up	to	places	like	this	in	the
wee	hours."
Book 2,"I	stuffed	my	clipboard	under	the	armrest,	grabbed	my	gear,	and
began	restocking	rat	traps."
Book 2,"They’re	everywhere,	those	little	green	boxes."
Book 2,"Look	around	almost	any	restaurant
and	you’ll	find	them,	hidden	in	plain	sight."
Book 2,"My	job	was	to	bait,	move,	or	replace
them."
Book 2,"Sometimes	I	hit	pay	dirt	and	found	a	rat	carcass,	which	never	caught	me
by	surprise."
Book 2,You	know	death	when	you	smell	it.
Book 2,"This	wasn’t	the	mission	I	signed	up	for	when	I	enlisted	in	the	Air	Force	with
dreams	of	joining	a	Pararescue	unit."
Book 2,"Back	then	I	was	nineteen	years	old	and
weighed	175	pounds."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	was	discharged	four	years	later,	I	had
ballooned	to	nearly	300	pounds	and	was	on	a	different	kind	of	patrol."
Book 2,"At	that
weight,	even	bending	down	to	bait	the	traps	took	effort."
Book 2,"I	was	so	damn	fat	I	had
to	sew	an	athletic	sock	into	the	crotch	of	my	work	pants	so	they	wouldn’t	split
when	I	dropped	to	one	knee."
Book 2,No	bullshit.
Book 2,I	was	a	sorry	fucking	sight.
Book 2,"With	the	exterior	handled,	it	was	time	to	venture	indoors,	which	was	its	own
wilderness."
Book 2,"I	had	keys	to	almost	every	restaurant	in	this	part	of	Indianapolis,	and
their	alarm	codes	too."
Book 2,"Once	inside,	I	pumped	my	hand-held	silver	canister	full	of
poison	and	placed	a	fumigation	mask	over	my	face."
Book 2,"I	looked	like	a	damn	space
alien	in	that	thing,	with	its	dual	filters	jutting	out	from	my	mouth,	protecting	me
from	toxic	fumes."
Book 2,"Protecting	me.If	there	was	anything	I	liked	about	that	job	it	was	the	stealth	nature	of	working
late,	moving	in	and	out	of	inky	shadows."
Book 2,I	loved	that	mask	for	the	same	reason.
Book 2,"It	was	vital,	and	not	because	of	any	damn	insecticide."
Book 2,"I	needed	it	because	it	made
it	impossible	for	anyone	to	see	me,	especially	me."
Book 2,"Even	if	by	chance	I	caught	my
own	reflection	in	a	glass	doorway	or	on	a	stainless	steel	countertop,	it	wasn’t	me
I	was	seeing."
Book 2,"It	was	some	janky-ass,	low-budget	storm	trooper."
Book 2,"The	kind	of	guy
who	would	palm	yesterday’s	brownies	on	his	way	out	the	door."
Book 2,It	wasn’t	me.
Book 2,"Sometimes	I’d	see	roaches	scurry	for	cover	when	I	flipped	the	lights	on	to	spray
down	the	counters	and	the	tiled	floors."
Book 2,"I’d	see	dead	rodents	stuck	to	sticky	traps
I’d	laid	on	previous	visits."
Book 2,I	bagged	and	dumped	them.
Book 2,"I	checked	the	lighting
systems	I’d	installed	to	catch	moths	and	flies	and	cleaned	those	out	too."
Book 2,"Within	a
half	hour	I	was	gone,	rolling	on	to	the	next	restaurant."
Book 2,"I	had	a	dozen	stops	every
night	and	had	to	hit	them	all	before	dawn."
Book 2,Maybe	this	kind	of	gig	sounds	disgusting	to	you.
Book 2,"When	I	think	back	I’m
disgusted	too,	but	not	because	of	the	job."
Book 2,It	was	honest	work.
Book 2,Necessary.
Book 2,"Hell,	in
Air	Force	boot	camp	I	got	on	the	wrong	side	of	my	first	drill	sergeant	and	she
made	me	the	latrine	queen."
Book 2,"It	was	my	job	to	keep	the	latrines	in	our	barracks
shining."
Book 2,"She	told	me	that	if	she	found	one	speck	of	dirt	in	that	latrine	at	any
moment	I	would	get	recycled	back	to	day	one	and	join	a	new	flight."
Book 2,"I	took	my
discipline."
Book 2,"I	was	happy	just	to	be	in	the	Air	Force,	and	I	cleaned	the	hell	out	of
that	latrine."
Book 2,You	could	have	eaten	off	that	floor.
Book 2,"Four	years	later,	the	guy	who
was	so	energized	by	opportunity	that	he	was	excited	to	clean	latrines	was	gone
and	I	didn’t	feel	anything	at	all."
Book 2,"They	say	there’s	always	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel,	but	not	once	your	eyes
adjust	to	the	darkness,	and	that’s	what	happened	to	me."
Book 2,I	was	numb.
Book 2,"Numb	to
my	life,	miserable	in	my	marriage,	and	I’d	accepted	that	reality."
Book 2,"I	was	a	would-
be	warrior	turned	cockroach	sniper	on	the	graveyard	shift."
Book 2,"Just	another	zombie
selling	his	time	on	earth,	going	through	the	motions."
Book 2,"In	fact,	the	only	insight	I
had	into	my	job	at	that	time	was	that	it	was	actually	a	step	up."
Book 2,"When	I	was	first	discharged	from	the	military	I	got	a	job	at	St.	Vincent’s
Hospital."
Book 2,"I	worked	security	from	11	p.m.	to	7	a.m.	for	minimum	wage	and
cleared	about	$700	a	month."
Book 2,"Every	now	and	then	I’d	see	an	Ecolab	truck	pull	up.We	were	on	the	exterminator’s	regular	rotation,	and	it	was	my	job	to	unlock	the
hospital	kitchen	for	him."
Book 2,"One	night	we	got	to	talking,	and	he	mentioned	that
Ecolab	was	hiring,	and	that	the	job	came	with	a	free	truck	and	no	boss	looking
over	your	shoulder."
Book 2,It	was	also	a	35	percent	pay	raise.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	think	about	the
health	risks."
Book 2,I	didn’t	think	at	all.
Book 2,I	was	taking	what	was	being	offered.
Book 2,"I	was	on
that	spoon-fed	path	of	least	resistance,	letting	dominoes	fall	on	my	head,	and	it
was	killing	me	slowly."
Book 2,"But	there’s	a	difference	between	being	numb	and
clueless."
Book 2,"In	the	dark	night	there	weren’t	a	lot	of	distractions	to	get	me	out	of	my
head,	and	I	knew	that	I	had	tipped	the	first	domino."
Book 2,"I’d	started	the	chain	reaction
that	put	me	on	Ecolab	duty."
Book 2,The	Air	Force	should	have	been	my	way	out.
Book 2,"That	first	drill	sergeant	did	end	up
recycling	me	into	a	different	unit,	and	in	my	new	flight	I	became	a	star	recruit."
Book 2,"I
was	6’2”	and	weighed	about	175	pounds."
Book 2,"I	was	fast	and	strong,	our	unit	was	the
best	flight	in	all	of	boot	camp,	and	soon	I	was	training	for	my	dream	job:	Air
Force	Pararescue."
Book 2,"We	were	guardian	angels	with	fangs,	trained	to	drop	from	the
sky	behind	enemy	lines	and	pull	downed	pilots	out	of	harm’s	way."
Book 2,"I	was	one	of
the	best	guys	in	that	training."
Book 2,"I	was	one	of	the	best	at	push-ups,	and	the	best	at
sit-ups,	flutter	kicks,	and	running."
Book 2,"I	was	one	point	behind	honor	grad,	but	there
was	something	they	didn’t	talk	about	in	the	lead-up	to	Pararescue	training:	water
confidence."
Book 2,"That’s	a	nice	name	for	a	course	where	they	try	to	drown	your	ass	for
weeks,	and	I	was	uncomfortable	as	hell	in	the	water."
Book 2,"Although	my	mom	got	us	off	the	public	dole	and	out	of	subsidized	housing
within	three	years,	she	still	didn’t	have	extra	cash	for	swim	lessons,	and	we
avoided	pools."
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	until	I	attended	Boy	Scout	camp	when	I	was	twelve
years	old	that	I	was	finally	confronted	with	swimming."
Book 2,"Leaving	Buffalo	allowed
me	to	join	the	Scouts,	and	camp	was	my	best	opportunity	to	score	all	the	merit
badges	I’d	need	to	stay	on	the	path	to	becoming	an	Eagle	Scout."
Book 2,"One	morning	it
was	time	to	qualify	for	the	swimming	merit	badge	and	that	meant	a	one-mile
swim	in	a	lake	course,	marked	off	with	buoys."
Book 2,"All	the	other	kids	jumped	in	and
started	getting	after	it,	and	if	I	wanted	to	save	face	I	had	to	pretend	I	knew	what	I
was	doing,	so	I	followed	them	into	the	lake."
Book 2,"I	dog	paddled	the	best	I	could,	but
kept	swallowing	water	so	I	flipped	onto	my	back	and	ended	up	swimming	the
entire	mile	with	a	fucked-up	backstroke	I’d	improvised	on	the	fly."
Book 2,"Merit	badge
secured.When	it	came	time	to	take	the	swim	test	to	get	into	Pararescue,	I	needed	to	be
able	to	swim	for	real."
Book 2,"This	was	a	timed,	500-meter	freestyle	swim,	and	even	at
nineteen	years	old	I	didn’t	know	how	to	swim	freestyle."
Book 2,"So	I	took	my	stunted	ass
down	to	Barnes	&	Noble,	bought	Swimming	for	Dummies,	studied	the	diagrams,
and	practiced	in	the	pool	every	day."
Book 2,"I	hated	putting	my	face	in	the	water,	but	I’d
manage	for	one	stroke,	then	two,	and	before	long	I	could	swim	an	entire	lap."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	as	buoyant	as	most	swimmers.
Book 2,"Whenever	I	stopped	swimming,	even	for
a	moment,	I’d	start	to	sink,	which	made	my	heart	pound	with	panic,	and	my
increased	tension	just	made	it	worse."
Book 2,"Eventually,	I	passed	that	swim	test,	but
there	is	a	difference	between	being	competent	and	comfortable	in	the	water,
another	big	gap	from	comfortable	to	confident,	and	when	you	can’t	float	like
most	people,	water	confidence	does	not	come	easy."
Book 2,"Sometimes	it	doesn’t	come
at	all."
Book 2,"In	Pararescue	training,	water	confidence	is	part	of	the	ten-week	program,	and	it’s
filled	with	specific	evolutions	designed	to	test	how	well	we	perform	in	the	water
under	stress."
Book 2,One	of	the	worst	evolutions	for	me	was	called	Bobbing.
Book 2,"The	class
was	divided	into	groups	of	five,	lined	up	from	gutter	to	gutter	in	the	shallow	end,
and	fully	kitted	up."
Book 2,"Our	backs	were	strapped	with	twin	eighty-liter	tanks	made
from	galvanized	steel,	and	we	wore	sixteen-pound	weight	belts	too."
Book 2,"We	were
loaded	the	fuck	down,	which	would	have	been	fine,	except	in	this	evolution	we
weren’t	allowed	to	breathe	from	those	tanks."
Book 2,"Instead,	we	were	told	to	walk
backward	down	the	slope	of	the	pool	from	the	three-foot	section	to	the	deep	end,
about	ten	feet	down,	and	on	that	slow	walk	into	position,	my	mind	swirled	with
doubt	and	negativity."
Book 2,What	the	fuck	are	you	doing	here?
Book 2,"This	isn’t	for	you!	You	can’t	swim!	You’re	an
imposter	and	they	will	find	you	out!
Time	slowed	down	and	those	seconds	seemed	like	minutes."
Book 2,"My	diaphragm
lurched,	trying	to	force	air	into	my	lungs."
Book 2,"Theoretically,	I	knew	that	relaxation
was	the	key	to	all	the	underwater	evolutions,	but	I	was	too	terrified	to	let	go."
Book 2,"My
jaw	clenched	as	tight	as	my	fists."
Book 2,"My	head	throbbed	as	I	worked	to	stave	off
panic."
Book 2,"Finally,	we	were	all	in	position	and	it	was	time	to	start	bobbing."
Book 2,"That
meant	pushing	up	from	the	bottom	to	the	surface	(without	the	benefit	of	finning),
getting	a	gulp	of	air,	and	sinking	back	down."
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	easy,	getting	up	fully
loaded,	but	at	least	I	was	able	to	breathe,	and	that	first	breath	was	a	salvation.Oxygen	flooded	my	system	and	I	started	to	relax	until	the	instructor	yelled
“Switch!”	That	was	our	cue	to	take	our	fins	from	our	feet,	place	them	on	our
hands,	and	use	one	pull	with	our	arms	to	propel	ourselves	to	the	surface."
Book 2,"We
were	allowed	to	push	off	the	floor	of	the	pool,	but	we	couldn’t	kick."
Book 2,"We	did	that
for	five	minutes."
Book 2,"Shallow	water	and	surface	blackouts	aren’t	uncommon	during	water	confidence
training."
Book 2,It	goes	along	with	stressing	the	body	and	limiting	oxygen	intake.
Book 2,"With
the	flippers	on	my	hands	I’d	barely	get	my	face	high	enough	out	of	the	water	to
breathe,	and	in	between	I	was	working	hard	and	burning	oxygen."
Book 2,"And	when	you
burn	too	much	too	fast,	your	brain	shuts	down	and	you	will	black	the	fuck	out."
Book 2,"Our	instructors	called	that,	“meeting	the	wizard.”	As	the	clock	ticked,	I	could	see
stars	materializing	in	my	peripheral	vision	and	felt	the	wizard	creeping	close."
Book 2,"I	passed	that	evolution,	and	soon,	finning	with	my	arms	or	feet	became	easy	for
me."
Book 2,"What	stayed	hard	from	beginning	to	end	was	one	of	our	simplest	tasks:
treading	water	without	our	hands."
Book 2,"We	had	to	keep	our	hands	and	our	chins	high
above	the	water,	using	only	our	legs,	which	we’d	swirl	in	a	blender-like	motion,
for	three	minutes."
Book 2,"That	doesn’t	sound	like	much	time,	and	for	most	of	the	class	it
was	easy."
Book 2,"For	me,	it	was	damn	near	impossible."
Book 2,"My	chin	kept	hitting	the	water,
which	meant	the	time	would	start	again	from	triple	zero."
Book 2,"All	around	me,	my
classmates	were	so	comfortable	their	legs	were	barely	moving,	while	mine	were
whirring	at	top	speed,	and	I	still	couldn’t	get	half	as	high	as	those	white	boys
who	looked	to	be	defying	gravity."
Book 2,Every	day	it	was	another	humiliation	in	the	pool.
Book 2,"Not	that	I	was	embarrassed
publicly."
Book 2,"I	passed	all	the	evolutions,	but	inside	I	was	suffering."
Book 2,"Each	night,	I’d
fixate	on	the	next	day’s	task	and	become	so	terrified	I	couldn’t	sleep,	and	soon
my	fear	morphed	into	resentment	toward	my	classmates	who,	in	my	mind,	had	it
easy,	which	dredged	up	my	past."
Book 2,"I	was	the	only	black	man	in	my	unit,	which	reminded	me	of	my	childhood	in
rural	Indiana,	and	the	harder	the	water	confidence	training	became,	the	higher
those	dark	waters	would	rise	until	it	seemed	I	was	also	being	drowned	from	the
inside	out."
Book 2,"While	the	rest	of	my	class	was	sleeping,	that	potent	cocktail	of	fear
and	rage	thrummed	through	my	veins	and	my	nocturnal	fixations	became	their
own	kind	of	self-fulfilling	prophecy."
Book 2,"One	where	failure	was	inevitable	because
my	unchecked	fear	was	unleashing	something	I	couldn’t	control:	the	quittingmind."
Book 2,It	all	came	to	a	head	six	weeks	into	training	with	the	“buddy	breathing”	exercise.
Book 2,"We	partnered	up,	each	pair	gripped	one	another	by	the	forearm,	and	took	turns
breathing	through	just	one	snorkel."
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	the	instructors	thrashed	us,
trying	to	separate	us	from	our	snorkel."
Book 2,"All	of	this	was	supposed	to	be	happening
at	or	near	the	surface,	but	I	was	negatively	buoyant,	which	meant	I	was	sinking
into	the	middle	waters	of	the	deep	end,	dragging	my	partner	down	with	me."
Book 2,"He’d
take	a	breath	and	pass	the	snorkel	down	to	me."
Book 2,"I’d	swim	to	the	surface,	exhale
and	attempt	to	clear	the	water	from	our	snorkel	and	get	a	clean	breath	before
passing	it	back	to	him,	but	the	instructors	made	that	almost	impossible."
Book 2,"I’d
usually	only	clear	the	tube	halfway,	and	inhale	more	water	than	air."
Book 2,"From	the
jump,	I	was	operating	from	an	oxygen	deficit	while	fighting	to	stay	near	the
surface."
Book 2,"In	military	training,	it’s	the	instructors’	job	to	identify	weak	links	and	challenge
them	to	perform	or	quit,	and	they	could	tell	I	was	struggling."
Book 2,"In	the	pool	that
day,	one	of	them	was	always	in	my	face,	yelling	and	thrashing	me,	while	I
choked,	trying	and	failing	to	gulp	air	through	a	narrow	tube	to	stave	off	the
wizard."
Book 2,"I	went	under	and	remember	looking	up	at	the	rest	of	the	class,	splayed
out	like	serene	starfish	on	the	surface."
Book 2,"Calm	as	can	be,	they	passed	their	snorkels
back	and	forth	with	ease,	while	I	fumed."
Book 2,"I	know	now	that	my	instructor	was	just
doing	his	job,	but	back	then	I	thought,	This	fucker’s	not	giving	me	a	fair	shot!
I	passed	that	evolution	too,	but	I	still	had	eleven	more	evolutions	and	four	more
weeks	of	water	confidence	training	to	go."
Book 2,It	made	sense.
Book 2,"We	would	be	jumping
out	of	airplanes	over	water."
Book 2,We	needed	it.
Book 2,"I	just	didn’t	want	to	do	it	anymore,
and	the	next	morning,	I	was	offered	a	way	out	I	hadn’t	seen	coming."
Book 2,"Weeks	earlier,	we’d	had	our	blood	drawn	during	a	med	check,	and	the	doctors
had	just	discovered	I	carried	the	Sickle	Cell	Trait."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	have	the	disease,
Sickle	Cell	Anemia,	but	I	had	the	trait,	which	was	believed	at	the	time	to
increase	the	risk	of	sudden,	exercise-related	death	due	to	cardiac	arrest."
Book 2,"The	Air
Force	didn’t	want	me	dropping	dead	in	the	middle	of	an	evolution	and	pulled	me
out	of	training	on	a	medical."
Book 2,"I	pretended	to	take	the	news	hard,	as	if	my	dream
was	being	ripped	away."
Book 2,"I	made	a	big	fucking	act	of	being	pissed	off,	but	inside	I
was	ecstatic.Later	that	week	the	doctors	reversed	their	decision."
Book 2,"They	didn’t	specifically	say
it	was	safe	for	me	to	continue,	but	they	said	the	trait	wasn’t	yet	well	understood
and	allowed	me	to	decide	for	myself."
Book 2,"When	I	reported	back	to	training	the
Master	Sergeant	(MSgt)	informed	me	that	I’d	missed	too	much	time	and	that	if	I
wanted	to	continue	I	would	have	to	start	over	from	day	one,	week	one."
Book 2,"Instead	of
less	than	four	weeks,	I’d	have	to	endure	another	ten	weeks	of	the	terror,	rage,
and	insomnia	that	came	with	water	confidence."
Book 2,"These	days,	that	kind	of	thing	wouldn’t	even	register	on	my	radar."
Book 2,"You	tell	me	to
run	longer	and	harder	than	everyone	else	just	to	get	a	fair	shake,	I’d	say,	“Roger
that,”	and	keep	moving,	but	back	then	I	was	still	half-baked."
Book 2,"Physically	I	was
strong,	but	I	was	not	even	close	to	mastering	my	mind."
Book 2,"The	MSgt	stared	at	me,	awaiting	my	response."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	even	look	him	in	the
eye	when	I	said,	“You	know	what,	Master	Sergeant,	the	doctor	doesn’t	know
much	about	this	Sickle	Cell	thing,	and	it’s	bothering	me.”
He	nodded,	emotionless,	and	signed	the	papers	pulling	me	out	of	the	program	for
good."
Book 2,"He	cited	Sickle	Cell,	and	on	paper	I	didn’t	quit,	but	I	knew	the	truth."
Book 2,"If	I
had	been	the	guy	I	am	today,	I	wouldn’t	have	given	two	fucks	about	Sickle	Cell."
Book 2,I	still	have	the	Sickle	Cell	Trait.
Book 2,"You	don’t	just	get	rid	of	it,	but	back	then	an
obstacle	had	appeared,	and	I’d	folded."
Book 2,"I	moved	on	to	Fort	Campbell,	Kentucky,	told	my	friends	and	family	that	I	was
forced	from	the	program	on	a	medical,	and	served	out	my	four	years	in	the
Tactical	Air	Control	Party	(TAC-P),	which	works	with	some	special	operations
units."
Book 2,"I	trained	to	liaise	between	ground	units	and	air	support—fast	movers	like
F-15s	and	F-16s—behind	enemy	lines."
Book 2,"It	was	challenging	work	with	intelligent
people,	but	sadly	I	was	never	proud	of	it	and	didn’t	see	the	opportunities	offered
because	I	knew	I	was	a	quitter	who	had	let	fear	dictate	my	future."
Book 2,I	buried	my	shame	in	the	gym	and	at	the	kitchen	table.
Book 2,"I	got	into	powerlifting
and	layered	on	the	mass."
Book 2,I	ate	and	worked	out.
Book 2,Worked	out	and	ate.
Book 2,"In	my	last
days	in	the	Air	Force	I	weighed	255	pounds."

person	into	those	21-inch	biceps	and	that	flabby	belly."
Book 2,"I	grew	a	burly	mustache

Hostess	mini	chocolate	doughnuts."
Book 2,"I	gobbled	those	on	my	forty-five-minute
drive	home,	to	a	beautiful	apartment	on	a	golf	course	in	pretty	Carmel,	Indiana,
which	I	shared	with	my	wife,	Pam,	and	her	daughter."
Book 2,"Remember	that	Pizza	Hut
incident?"
Book 2,I	married	that	girl.
Book 2,I	married	a	girl	whose	dad	called	me	a	nigger.

Book 2,We	couldn’t	afford	that	life.
Book 2,"Pam	wasn’t	even	working,	but	in	those	credit-card-
debt-loading	days,	nothing	made	much	sense."
Book 2,"I	was	doing	70	mph	on	the

Book 2,Darkness	was	a	friend	indeed.

Book 2,"Nobody	would	have	believed	how	numb	and	afraid	I	was	back
then	because	I	looked	like	a	beast	that	no	one	would	dare	fuck	with,	but	my
mind	wasn’t	right,	and	my	soul	was	weighed	down	by	too	much	trauma	and
failure."
Book 2,"I	had	every	excuse	in	the	world	to	be	a	loser,	and	used	them	all."
Book 2,"My	life

Book 2,"I	arrived	home	from	work	around	8	a.m.,	and	the	phone	rang	as	soon	as	I	walked
in	the	door."
Book 2,It	was	my	mother.
Book 2,She	knew	my	routine.
Book 2,"“Come	on	over	for	your	staple,”	she	said."
Book 2,"My	staple	was	a	breakfast	buffet	for	one,	the	likes	of	which	few	could	put	down

where	I	could	hear	a	narrator’s	voice	filter	through	the	steam."
Book 2,I	caught	snippets.
Book 2,"“Navy	SEALs…toughest…the	world.”	I	wrapped	a	towel	around	my	waist	and
rushed	back	into	the	living	room."
Book 2,"I	was	so	big,	the	towel	barely	covered	my	fat
ass,	but	I	sat	down	on	the	couch	and	didn’t	move	for	thirty	minutes."
Book 2,"The	show	followed	Basic	Underwater	Demolition	SEAL	(BUD/S)	Training
Class	224	through	Hell	Week:	the	most	arduous	series	of	tasks	in	the	most
physically	demanding	training	in	the	military."
Book 2,"I	watched	men	sweat	and	suffer	as
they	tore	through	muddy	obstacle	courses,	ran	on	the	soft	sand	holding	logs
overhead,	and	shivered	in	icy	surf."
Book 2,"Sweat	pearled	on	my	scalp,	I	was	literally	on
the	edge	of	my	seat	as	I	saw	guys—some	of	the	strongest	of	them	all—ring	the
bell	and	quit."
Book 2,Made	sense.
Book 2,"Only	one-third	of	the	men	who	begin	BUD/S	make	it
through	Hell	Week,	and	in	all	of	my	time	in	Pararescue	training,	I	couldn’t
remember	feeling	as	awful	as	these	men	looked."
Book 2,"They	were	swollen,	chafed,
sleep-deprived,	and	dead	on	their	feet,	and	I	was	jealous	of	them."
Book 2,"The	longer	I	watched	the	more	certain	I	became	that	there	were	answers	buried
in	all	that	suffering."
Book 2,Answers	that	I	needed.
Book 2,"More	than	once	the	camera	panned
over	the	endless	frothing	ocean,	and	each	time	I	felt	pathetic."
Book 2,"The	SEALs	were
everything	I	wasn’t."
Book 2,"They	were	about	pride,	dignity,	and	the	type	of	excellence
that	came	from	bathing	in	the	fire,	getting	beat	the	fuck	down,	and	going	back
for	more,	again	and	again."
Book 2,"They	were	the	human	equivalent	of	the	hardest,
sharpest	sword	you	could	imagine."
Book 2,"They	sought	out	the	flame,	took	the	pounding
for	as	long	as	necessary,	longer	even,	until	they	were	fearless	and	deadly."
Book 2,"They
weren’t	motivated."
Book 2,They	were	driven.
Book 2,The	show	ended	with	graduation.
Book 2,"Twenty-
two	proud	men	stood	shoulder	to	shoulder	in	their	dress	whites	before	the
camera	pushed	in	on	their	Commanding	Officer."
Book 2,"“In	a	society	where	mediocrity	is	too	often	the	standard	and	too	often	rewarded,”
he	said,	“there	is	intense	fascination	with	men	who	detest	mediocrity,	who	refuse
to	define	themselves	in	conventional	terms,	and	who	seek	to	transcend
traditionally	recognized	human	capabilities."
Book 2,"This	is	exactly	the	type	of	person
BUD/S	is	meant	to	find."
Book 2,"The	man	who	finds	a	way	to	complete	each	and	every
task	to	the	best	of	his	ability."
Book 2,"The	man	who	will	adapt	and	overcome	any	and	all
obstacles.”
In	that	moment	it	felt	as	though	the	Commanding	Officer	was	talking	directly	tome,	but	after	the	show	ended	I	walked	back	to	the	bathroom,	faced	the	mirror,
and	stared	myself	down."
Book 2,I	looked	every	bit	of	300	pounds.
Book 2,"I	was	everything	all
the	haters	back	home	said	I	would	be:	uneducated,	with	no	real	world	skills,	zero
discipline,	and	a	dead-end	future."
Book 2,"Mediocrity	would	have	been	a	major
promotion."
Book 2,"I	was	at	the	bottom	of	the	barrel	of	life,	pooling	in	the	dregs,	but,	for
the	first	time	in	way	too	long,	I	was	awake."
Book 2,"I	barely	spoke	to	my	mother	during	breakfast,	and	only	ate	half	my	staple
because	my	mind	was	on	unfinished	business."
Book 2,"I’d	always	wanted	to	join	an	elite
special	operations	unit,	and	beneath	all	the	rolls	of	flesh	and	layers	of	failure,
that	desire	was	still	there."
Book 2,"Now	it	was	coming	back	to	life,	thanks	to	a	chance
viewing	of	a	show	that	continued	to	work	on	me	like	a	virus	moving	cell	to	cell,
taking	over."
Book 2,It	became	an	obsession	I	couldn’t	shake.
Book 2,"Every	morning	after	work	for	almost
three	weeks,	I	called	active	duty	recruiters	in	the	Navy	and	told	them	my	story."
Book 2,"I
called	offices	all	over	the	country."
Book 2,"I	said	I	was	willing	to	move	as	long	as	they
could	get	me	to	SEAL	training."
Book 2,Everyone	turned	me	down.
Book 2,"Most	weren’t
interested	in	candidates	with	prior	service."
Book 2,"One	local	recruiting	office	was
intrigued	and	wanted	to	meet	in	person,	but	when	I	got	there	they	laughed	in	my
face."
Book 2,"I	was	way	too	heavy,	and	in	their	eyes	I	was	just	another	delusional
pretender."
Book 2,I	left	that	meeting	feeling	the	same	way.
Book 2,"After	calling	all	the	active	duty	recruiting	offices	I	could	find,	I	dialed	the	local
unit	of	the	Naval	reserves,	and	spoke	to	Petty	Officer	Steven	Schaljo	for	the	first
time."
Book 2,"Schaljo	had	worked	with	multiple	F-14	Squadrons	as	an	electrician	and
instructor	at	NAS	Miramar	for	eight	years	before	joining	the	recruitment	staff	in
San	Diego,	where	the	SEALs	train."
Book 2,"He	worked	day	and	night	and	rose	quickly	in
the	ranks."
Book 2,"His	move	to	Indianapolis	came	with	a	promotion	and	the	challenge	of
finding	Navy	recruits	in	the	middle	of	the	corn."
Book 2,"He’d	only	been	on	the	job	in
Indy	for	ten	days	by	the	time	I	called,	and	if	I’d	reached	anyone	else	you
probably	wouldn’t	be	reading	this	book."
Book 2,"But	through	a	combination	of	dumb
luck	and	stubborn	persistence	I	found	one	of	the	finest	recruiters	in	the	Navy,	a
guy	whose	favorite	task	was	discovering	diamonds	in	the	rough—prior	service
guys	like	me	who	were	looking	to	re-enlist	and	hoping	to	land	in	special
operations."
Book 2,Our	initial	conversation	didn’t	last	long.
Book 2,He	said	he	could	help	me	and	that	Ishould	come	in	to	meet	in	person.
Book 2,That	sounded	familiar.
Book 2,"I	grabbed	my	keys	and
drove	straight	to	his	office,	but	didn’t	get	my	hopes	too	high."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I
arrived	a	half-hour	later	he	was	already	on	the	phone	with	BUD/S
administration."
Book 2,"Every	sailor	in	that	office—all	of	them	white—were	surprised	to	see	me	except
Schaljo."
Book 2,"If	I	was	a	heavyweight,	Schaljo	was	a	lightweight	at	5’7”,	but	he	didn’t
seem	fazed	by	my	size,	at	least	not	at	first."
Book 2,"He	was	outgoing	and	warm,	like	any
salesman,	though	I	could	tell	he	had	some	pit	bull	in	him."
Book 2,"He	led	me	down	a	hall
to	weigh	me	in,	and	while	standing	on	the	scale	I	eyed	a	weight	chart	pinned	to
the	wall."
Book 2,"At	my	height,	the	maximum	allowable	weight	for	the	Navy	was	191
pounds."
Book 2,"I	held	my	breath,	sucked	in	my	gut	as	much	as	I	could,	and	puffed	out
my	chest	in	a	sorry	attempt	to	stave	off	the	humiliating	moment	where	he’d	let
me	down	easy."
Book 2,That	moment	never	came.
Book 2,"“You’re	a	big	boy,”	Schaljo	said,	smiling	and	shaking	his	head,	as	he	scratched
297	pounds	on	a	chart	in	his	file	folder."
Book 2,"“The	Navy	has	a	program	that	allows
recruits	in	the	reserves	to	become	active	duty."
Book 2,That’s	what	we’ll	use	for	this.
Book 2,"It’s
being	phased	out	at	the	end	of	the	year,	so	we	need	to	get	you	classed	up	before
then."
Book 2,"Point	is,	you	have	some	work	to	do,	but	you	knew	that.”	I	followed	his
eyes	to	the	weight	chart	and	checked	it	again."
Book 2,"He	nodded,	smiled,	patted	me	on
the	shoulder,	and	left	me	to	face	my	truth."
Book 2,I	had	less	than	three	months	to	lose	106	pounds.
Book 2,"It	sounded	like	an	impossible	task,	which	is	one	reason	I	didn’t	quit	my	job."
Book 2,"The
other	was	the	ASVAB."
Book 2,"That	nightmare	test	had	come	back	to	life	like
Frankenstein’s	fucking	monster."
Book 2,"I’d	passed	it	once	before	to	enlist	in	the	Air
Force,	but	to	qualify	for	BUD/S	I’d	have	to	score	much	higher."
Book 2,"For	two	weeks	I
studied	all	day	and	zapped	pests	each	night."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	working	out	yet.
Book 2,"Serious
weight	loss	would	have	to	wait."
Book 2,I	took	the	test	on	a	Saturday	afternoon.
Book 2,The	following	Monday	I	called	Schaljo.
Book 2,"“Welcome	to	the	Navy,”	he	said."
Book 2,He	downloaded	the	good	news	first.
Book 2,"I’d	done
exceptionally	well	on	some	sections	and	was	now	officially	a	reservist,	but	I’d
only	scored	a	44	on	Mechanical	Comprehension."
Book 2,"To	qualify	for	BUD/S	I	needed
a	50."
Book 2,"I’d	have	to	retake	the	entire	test	in	five	weeks.These	days	Steven	Schaljo	likes	to	call	our	chance	connection	“fate.”	He	said	he
could	sense	my	drive	the	first	moment	we	spoke,	and	that	he	believed	in	me
from	the	jump,	which	is	why	my	weight	wasn’t	an	issue	for	him,	but	after	that
ASVAB	test	I	was	full	of	doubt."
Book 2,"So	maybe	what	happened	later	that	night	was
also	a	form	of	fate,	or	a	much	needed	dose	of	divine	intervention."
Book 2,"I’m	not	going	to	drop	the	name	of	the	restaurant	where	it	went	down	because	if	I
did	you’d	never	eat	there	again	and	I’d	have	to	hire	a	lawyer."
Book 2,"Just	know,	this
place	was	a	disaster."
Book 2,I	checked	the	traps	outside	first	and	found	a	dead	rat.
Book 2,"Inside,	there	were	more	dead	rodents—a	mouse	and	two	rats—on	the	sticky
traps,	and	roaches	in	the	garbage	which	hadn’t	been	emptied."
Book 2,"I	shook	my	head,
got	down	on	my	knees	under	the	sink,	and	sprayed	up	through	a	narrow	gap	in
the	wall."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	it	yet,	but	I’d	found	their	nesting	column	and	when	the
poison	hit	they	started	to	scatter."
Book 2,Within	seconds	there	was	a	skittering	across	the	back	of	my	neck.
Book 2,"I	brushed	it
off,	and	craned	my	neck	to	see	a	storm	of	roaches	raining	down	to	the	kitchen
floor	from	an	open	panel	in	the	ceiling."
Book 2,"I’d	hit	the	motherlode	of	cockroaches
and	the	worst	infestation	I	ever	saw	on	the	job	for	Ecolab."
Book 2,They	kept	coming.
Book 2,Roaches	landed	on	my	shoulders	and	my	head.
Book 2,"The	floor	was	writhing	with
them."
Book 2,"I	left	my	canister	in	the	kitchen,	grabbed	the	sticky	traps,	and	burst	outside."
Book 2,"I
needed	fresh	air	and	more	time	to	figure	out	how	I	was	going	to	clear	the
restaurant	of	vermin."
Book 2,"I	considered	my	options	on	my	way	to	the	dumpster	to
trash	the	rodents,	opened	the	lid,	and	found	a	live	raccoon,	hissing	mad."
Book 2,"He
bared	his	yellow	teeth	and	lunged	at	me."
Book 2,I	slammed	the	dumpster	shut.
Book 2,What	the	fuck?
Book 2,"I	mean,	seriously,	what	the	fucking	fuck?"
Book 2,"When	was	enough
truly	going	to	be	enough?"
Book 2,"Was	I	willing	to	let	my	sorry	present	become	a
fucked-up	future?"
Book 2,"How	much	longer	would	I	wait,	how	many	more	years	would
I	burn,	wondering	if	there	was	some	greater	purpose	out	there	waiting	for	me?"
Book 2,"I
knew	right	then	that	if	I	didn’t	make	a	stand	and	start	walking	the	path	of	most
resistance,	I	would	end	up	in	this	mental	hell	forever."
Book 2,I	didn’t	go	back	inside	that	restaurant.
Book 2,I	didn’t	collect	my	gear.
Book 2,"I	started	my
truck,	stopped	for	a	chocolate	shake—my	comfort	tea	at	that	time—and	drove
home."
Book 2,It	was	still	dark	when	I	pulled	up.
Book 2,I	didn’t	care.
Book 2,"I	stripped	off	my	workclothes,	put	on	some	sweats	and	laced	up	my	running	shoes."
Book 2,"I	hadn’t	run	in	over
a	year,	but	I	hit	the	streets	ready	to	go	four	miles."
Book 2,I	lasted	400	yards.
Book 2,My	heart	raced.
Book 2,"I	was	so	dizzy	I	had	to	sit	down	on	the	edge
of	the	golf	course	to	catch	my	breath	before	making	the	slow	walk	back	to	my
house,	where	my	melted	shake	was	waiting	to	comfort	me	in	yet	another	failure."
Book 2,"I	grabbed	it,	slurped,	and	slumped	into	my	sofa."
Book 2,My	eyes	welled	with	tears.
Book 2,Who	the	fuck	did	I	think	I	was?
Book 2,"I	was	born	nothing,	I’d	proven	nothing,	and	I
still	wasn’t	worth	a	damn	thing."
Book 2,"David	Goggins,	a	Navy	SEAL?"
Book 2,"Yeah,	right."
Book 2,What	a	pipe	dream.
Book 2,I	couldn’t	even	run	down	the	block	for	five	minutes.
Book 2,"All	my
fears	and	insecurities	I’d	bottled	up	for	my	entire	life	started	raining	down	on	my
head."
Book 2,I	was	on	the	verge	of	giving	in	and	giving	up	for	good.
Book 2,"That’s	when	I
found	my	old,	beat	to	shit	VHS	copy	of	Rocky	(the	one	I’d	had	for	fifteen	years),
slid	it	into	the	machine,	and	fast	forwarded	to	my	favorite	scene:	Round	14."
Book 2,"The	original	Rocky	is	still	one	of	my	all-time	favorite	films	because	it’s	about	a
know-nothing	journeyman	fighter	living	in	poverty	with	no	prospects."
Book 2,"Even	his
own	trainer	won’t	work	with	him."
Book 2,"Then,	out	of	the	blue,	he’s	given	a	title	shot
with	the	champion,	Apollo	Creed,	the	most	feared	fighter	in	history,	a	man	that
has	knocked	out	every	opponent	he’s	ever	faced."
Book 2,"All	Rocky	wants	is	to	be	the
first	to	go	the	distance	with	Creed."
Book 2,"That	alone	will	make	him	someone	he	could
be	proud	of	for	the	first	time	in	his	life."
Book 2,"The	fight	is	closer	than	anyone	anticipated,	bloody	and	intense,	and	by	the
middle	rounds	Rocky	is	taking	on	more	and	more	punishment."
Book 2,"He’s	losing	the
fight,	and	in	Round	14	he	gets	knocked	down	early,	but	pops	right	back	up	in	the
center	of	the	ring."
Book 2,"Apollo	moves	in,	stalking	him	like	a	lion."
Book 2,"He	throws	sharp	left
jabs,	hits	a	slow-footed	Rocky	with	a	staggering	combination,	lands	a	punishing
right	hook,	and	another."
Book 2,He	backs	Rocky	into	a	corner.
Book 2,Rocky’s	legs	are	jelly.
Book 2,He	can’t	even	muster	the	strength	to	raise	his	arms	in	defense.
Book 2,"Apollo	slams
another	right	hook	into	the	side	of	Rocky’s	head,	then	a	left	hook,	and	a	vicious
right-handed	uppercut	that	puts	Rocky	down."
Book 2,"Apollo	retreats	to	the	opposite	corner	with	his	arms	held	high,	but	even	face
down	in	that	ring,	Rocky	doesn’t	give	up."
Book 2,"As	the	referee	begins	his	ten-count,
Rocky	squirms	toward	the	ropes."
Book 2,"Mickey,	his	own	trainer,	urges	him	to	stay
down,	but	Rocky	isn’t	hearing	it."
Book 2,"He	pulls	himself	up	to	one	knee,	then	all	fours.The	referee	hits	six	as	Rocky	grabs	the	ropes	and	rises	up."
Book 2,"The	crowd	roars,	and
Apollo	turns	to	see	him	still	standing."
Book 2,Rocky	waves	Apollo	over.
Book 2,"The	champ’s
shoulders	slump	in	disbelief."
Book 2,The	fight	isn’t	over	yet.
Book 2,I	turned	off	the	television	and	thought	about	my	own	life.
Book 2,"It	was	a	life	devoid	of
any	drive	and	passion,	but	I	knew	if	I	continued	to	surrender	to	my	fear	and	my
feelings	of	inadequacy,	I	would	be	allowing	them	to	dictate	my	future	forever."
Book 2,"My	only	other	choice	was	to	try	to	find	the	power	in	the	emotions	that	had	laid
me	low,	harness	and	use	them	to	empower	me	to	rise	up,	which	is	exactly	what	I
did."
Book 2,"I	dumped	that	shake	in	the	trash,	laced	up	my	shoes,	and	hit	the	streets	again."
Book 2,"On
my	first	run,	I	felt	severe	pain	in	my	legs	and	my	lungs	at	a	quarter	mile."
Book 2,"My
heart	raced	and	I	stopped."
Book 2,"This	time	I	felt	the	same	pain,	my	heart	raced	like	a
car	running	hot,	but	I	ran	through	it	and	the	pain	faded."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	bent	over
to	catch	my	breath,	I’d	run	a	full	mile."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	first	realized	that	not	all	physical	and	mental	limitations	are	real,
and	that	I	had	a	habit	of	giving	up	way	too	soon."
Book 2,"I	also	knew	that	it	would	take
every	ounce	of	courage	and	toughness	I	could	muster	to	pull	off	the	impossible."
Book 2,"I
was	staring	at	hours,	days,	and	weeks	of	non-stop	suffering."
Book 2,"I	would	have	to
push	myself	to	the	very	edge	of	my	mortality."
Book 2,"I	had	to	accept	the	very	real
possibility	that	I	might	die	because	this	time	I	wouldn’t	quit,	no	matter	how	fast
my	heart	raced	and	no	matter	how	much	pain	I	was	in."
Book 2,"Trouble	was	there	was	no
battle	plan	to	follow,	no	blueprint."
Book 2,I	had	to	create	one	from	scratch.
Book 2,The	typical	day	went	something	like	this.
Book 2,"I’d	wake	up	at	4:30	a.m.,	munch	a
banana,	and	hit	the	ASVAB	books."
Book 2,"Around	5	a.m.,	I’d	take	that	book	to	my
stationary	bike	where	I’d	sweat	and	study	for	two	hours."
Book 2,"Remember,	my	body
was	a	mess."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	run	multiple	miles	yet,	so	I	had	to	burn	as	many	calories
as	I	could	on	the	bike."
Book 2,"After	that	I’d	drive	over	to	Carmel	High	School	and	jump
into	the	pool	for	a	two-hour	swim."
Book 2,"From	there	I	hit	the	gym	for	a	circuit	workout
that	included	the	bench	press,	the	incline	press,	and	lots	of	leg	exercises."
Book 2,"Bulk
was	the	enemy."
Book 2,"I	needed	reps,	and	I	did	five	or	six	sets	of	100–200	reps	each."
Book 2,Then	it	was	back	to	the	stationary	bike	for	two	more	hours.I	was	constantly	hungry.
Book 2,"Dinner	was	my	one	true	meal	each	day,	but	there
wasn’t	much	to	it."
Book 2,"I	ate	a	grilled	or	sautéed	chicken	breast	and	some	sautéed
vegetables	along	with	a	thimble	of	rice."
Book 2,"After	dinner	I’d	do	another	two	hours	on
the	bike,	hit	the	sack,	wake	up	and	do	it	all	over	again,	knowing	the	odds	were
stacked	sky	high	against	me."
Book 2,"What	I	was	trying	to	achieve	is	like	a	D-student
applying	to	Harvard,	or	walking	into	a	casino	and	putting	every	single	dollar	you
own	on	a	number	in	roulette	and	acting	as	if	winning	is	a	foregone	conclusion."
Book 2,"I
was	betting	everything	I	had	on	myself	with	no	guarantees."
Book 2,"I	weighed	myself	twice	daily,	and	within	two	weeks	I’d	dropped	twenty-five
pounds."
Book 2,"My	progress	only	improved	as	I	kept	grinding,	and	the	weight	started
peeling	off."
Book 2,"Ten	days	later	I	was	at	250,	light	enough	to	begin	doing	push-ups,
pull-ups,	and	to	start	running	my	ass	off."
Book 2,"I’d	still	wake	up,	hit	the	stationary	bike,
the	pool,	and	the	gym,	but	I	also	incorporated	two-,	three-,	and	four-mile	runs."
Book 2,"I
ditched	my	running	shoes	and	ordered	a	pair	of	Bates	Lites,	the	same	boots
SEAL	candidates	wear	in	BUD/S,	and	started	running	in	those."
Book 2,"With	so	much	effort,	you’d	think	my	nights	would	have	been	restful,	but	they
were	filled	with	anxiety."
Book 2,My	stomach	growled	and	my	mind	swirled.
Book 2,"I’d	dream
of	complex	ASVAB	questions	and	dread	the	next	day’s	workouts."
Book 2,"I	was	putting
out	so	much,	on	almost	no	fuel,	that	depression	became	a	natural	side	effect."
Book 2,"My
splintering	marriage	was	veering	toward	divorce."
Book 2,"Pam	made	it	very	clear	that	she
and	my	stepdaughter	would	not	be	moving	to	San	Diego	with	me,	if	by	some
miracle	I	could	pull	this	off."
Book 2,"They	stayed	in	Brazil	most	of	the	time,	and	when	I
was	all	alone	in	Carmel,	I	was	in	turmoil."
Book 2,"I	felt	both	worthless	and	helpless	as
my	endless	stream	of	self-defeating	thoughts	picked	up	steam."
Book 2,"When	depression	smothers	you,	it	blots	out	all	light	and	leaves	you	with	nothing
to	cling	onto	for	hope."
Book 2,All	you	see	is	negativity.
Book 2,"For	me,	the	only	way	to	make	it
through	that	was	to	feed	off	my	depression."
Book 2,"I	had	to	flip	it	and	convince	myself
that	all	that	self-doubt	and	anxiety	was	confirmation	that	I	was	no	longer	living
an	aimless	life."
Book 2,"My	task	may	turn	out	to	be	impossible	but	at	least	I	was	back	on
a	motherfucking	mission."
Book 2,"Some	nights,	when	I	was	feeling	low,	I’d	call	Schaljo."
Book 2,"He	was	always	in	the
office	early	in	the	morning	and	late	at	night."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	confide	in	him	about	my
depression	because	I	didn’t	want	him	to	doubt	me."
Book 2,"I	used	those	calls	to	pump
myself	up."
Book 2,"I	told	him	how	many	pounds	I	dropped	and	how	much	work	I	wasputting	in,	and	he	reminded	me	to	keep	studying	for	that	ASVAB."
Book 2,Roger	that.
Book 2,"I	had	the	Rocky	soundtrack	on	cassette	and	I’d	listen	to	Going	the	Distance	for
inspiration."
Book 2,"On	long	bike	rides	and	runs,	with	those	horns	blasting	in	my	brain,
I’d	imagine	myself	going	through	BUD/S,	diving	into	cold	water,	and	crushing
Hell	Week."
Book 2,"I	was	wishing,	I	was	hoping,	but	by	the	time	I	was	down	to	250,	my
quest	to	qualify	for	the	SEALs	wasn’t	a	daydream	anymore."
Book 2,"I	had	a	real	chance
to	accomplish	something	most	people,	including	myself,	thought	was
impossible."
Book 2,"Still,	there	were	bad	days."
Book 2,"One	morning	not	long	after	I	dipped
below	250,	I	weighed	in	and	had	only	lost	a	pound	from	the	day	before."
Book 2,"I	had	so
much	weight	to	lose	I	could	not	afford	to	plateau."
Book 2,"That’s	all	I	thought	about
while	running	six	miles	and	swimming	two."
Book 2,"I	was	exhausted	and	sore	when	I
arrived	in	the	gym	for	my	typical	three-hour	circuit."
Book 2,"After	rocking	over	100	pull-ups	in	a	series	of	sets,	I	was	back	on	the	bar	for	a
max	set	with	no	ceiling."
Book 2,"Going	in,	my	goal	was	to	get	to	twelve	but	my	hands
were	burning	fire	as	I	stretched	my	chin	over	the	bar	for	the	tenth	time."
Book 2,"For
weeks,	the	temptation	to	pull	back	had	been	ever	present,	and	I	always	refused."
Book 2,"That	day,	however,	the	pain	was	too	much	and	after	my	eleventh	pull-up,	I	gave
in,	dropped	down,	and	finished	my	workout,	one	pull-up	shy."
Book 2,"That	one	rep	stayed	with	me,	along	with	that	one	pound."
Book 2,"I	tried	to	get	them	out
of	my	head	but	they	wouldn’t	leave	me	the	fuck	alone."
Book 2,"They	taunted	me	on	the
drive	home,	and	at	my	kitchen	table	while	I	ate	a	sliver	of	grilled	chicken	and	a
bland,	baked	potato."
Book 2,"I	knew	I	wouldn’t	sleep	that	night	unless	I	did	something
about	it,	so	I	grabbed	my	keys."
Book 2,"“You	cut	corners	and	you	are	not	gonna	fucking	make	it,”	I	said,	out	loud,	as	I
drove	back	to	the	gym."
Book 2,"“There	are	no	shortcuts	for	you,	Goggins!”
I	did	my	entire	pull-up	workout	over	again."
Book 2,"One	missed	pull-up	cost	me	an	extra
250,	and	there	would	be	similar	episodes."
Book 2,"Whenever	I	cut	a	run	or	swim	short
because	I	was	hungry	or	tired,	I’d	always	go	back	and	beat	myself	down	even
harder."
Book 2,That	was	the	only	way	I	could	manage	the	demons	in	my	mind.
Book 2,"Either
way	there	would	be	suffering."
Book 2,"I	had	to	choose	between	physical	suffering	in	the
moment,	and	the	mental	anguish	of	wondering	if	that	one	missed	pull-up,	thatlast	lap	in	the	pool,	the	quarter	mile	I	skipped	on	the	road	or	trail,	would	end	up
costing	me	an	opportunity	of	a	lifetime."
Book 2,It	was	an	easy	choice.
Book 2,"When	it	came	to
the	SEALs,	I	wasn’t	leaving	anything	up	to	chance."
Book 2,"On	the	eve	of	the	ASVAB,	with	four	weeks	to	go	before	training,	making	weight
was	no	longer	a	worry."
Book 2,"I	was	already	down	to	215	pounds	and	was	faster	and
stronger	than	I’d	ever	been."
Book 2,"I	was	running	six	miles	a	day,	bicycling	over	twenty
miles,	and	swimming	more	than	two."
Book 2,All	of	it	in	the	dead	of	winter.
Book 2,"My	favorite
run	was	the	six-mile	Monon	trail,	an	asphalt	bike	and	walking	path	that	laced
through	the	trees	in	Indianapolis."
Book 2,"It	was	the	domain	of	cyclists	and	soccer	moms
with	jogging	strollers,	weekend	warriors	and	seniors."
Book 2,"By	then	Schaljo	had	passed
along	the	Navy	SEAL	warning	order."
Book 2,"It	included	all	the	workouts	I	would	be
expected	to	complete	during	first	phase	of	BUD/S,	and	I	was	happy	to	double
them."
Book 2,"I	knew	that	190	men	usually	class-up	for	a	typical	SEAL	training	and	only
about	forty	people	make	it	all	the	way	through."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	want	to	be	just	one	of
those	forty."
Book 2,I	wanted	to	be	the	best.
Book 2,But	I	had	to	pass	the	damn	ASVAB	first.
Book 2,I’d	been	cramming	every	spare	second.
Book 2,"If	I	wasn’t	working	out,	I	was	at	my	kitchen	table,	memorizing	formulas	and
cycling	through	hundreds	of	vocabulary	words."
Book 2,"With	my	physical	training	going
well,	all	my	anxiety	stuck	to	the	ASVAB	like	paper	clips	to	a	magnet."
Book 2,"This
would	be	my	last	chance	to	take	the	test	before	my	eligibility	for	the	SEALs
expired."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	very	smart,	and	based	on	past	academic	performance	there	was
no	good	reason	to	believe	I’d	pass	with	a	score	high	enough	to	qualify	for	the
SEALs.	If	I	failed,	my	dream	would	die,	and	I’d	be	floating	without	purpose
once	again."
Book 2,"The	test	was	held	in	a	small	classroom	on	Fort	Benjamin	Harrison	in
Indianapolis."
Book 2,"There	were	about	thirty	people	there,	all	of	us	young."
Book 2,"Most	were
just	out	of	high	school."
Book 2,We	were	each	assigned	an	old-school	desktop	computer.
Book 2,"In	the	past	month,	the	test	had	been	digitized	and	I	wasn’t	experienced	with
computers."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	even	think	I	could	work	the	damn	machine	let	alone	answer
the	questions,	but	the	program	proved	idiot	proof	and	I	settled	in."
Book 2,"The	ASVAB	has	ten	sections,	and	I	was	breezing	through	until	I	reached
Mechanical	Comprehension,	my	truth	serum."
Book 2,"Within	the	hour	I	would	have	a
decent	idea	if	I’d	been	lying	to	myself	or	if	I	had	the	raw	stuff	necessary	to
become	a	SEAL."
Book 2,"Whenever	a	question	stumped	me,	I	marked	my	worksheetwith	a	dash."
Book 2,"There	were	about	thirty	questions	in	that	section	and	by	the	time	I
completed	the	test,	I’d	guessed	at	least	ten	times."
Book 2,"I	needed	some	of	them	to	go
my	way	or	I	was	out."
Book 2,"After	completing	the	final	section,	I	was	prompted	to	send	the	entire	bundle	to
the	administrator’s	computer	at	the	front	of	the	room	where	the	score	would	be
tabulated	instantly."
Book 2,"I	peeked	over	my	monitor	and	saw	him	sitting	there,	waiting."
Book 2,"I	pointed,	clicked,	and	left	the	room."
Book 2,"Buzzing	with	nervous	energy,	I	paced	the
parking	lot	for	a	few	minutes	before	finally	ducking	into	my	Honda	Accord,	but
I	didn’t	start	the	engine."
Book 2,I	couldn’t	leave.
Book 2,I	sat	in	the	front	seat	for	fifteen	minutes	with	a	thousand-yard	stare.
Book 2,"It	would	be
at	least	two	days	before	Schaljo	would	call	with	my	results,	but	the	answer	to	the
riddle	that	was	my	future	was	already	solved."
Book 2,"I	knew	exactly	where	it	was,	and	I
had	to	know	the	truth."
Book 2,"I	gathered	myself,	walked	back	in,	and	approached	the
fortune	teller."
Book 2,"“You	gotta	tell	me	what	I	got	on	this	fucking	test,	man,”	I	said."
Book 2,"He	peered	up	at
me,	surprised,	but	he	didn’t	buckle."
Book 2,"“I’m	sorry,	son."
Book 2,This	is	the	government.
Book 2,"There’s	a	system	for	how	they	do
things,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“I	didn’t	make	the	rules	and	I	can’t	bend	them.”
“Sir,	you	have	no	idea	what	this	test	means	to	me,	to	my	life."
Book 2,"It’s	everything!”
He	looked	into	my	glassy	eyes	for	what	felt	like	five	minutes,	then	turned	toward
his	machine."
Book 2,"“I’m	breaking	every	rule	in	the	book	right	now,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“Goggins,	right?”	I
nodded	and	came	around	behind	his	seat	as	he	scrolled	through	files."
Book 2,"“There	you
are."
Book 2,"Congratulations,	you	scored	65."
Book 2,"That’s	a	great	score.”	He	was	referencing
my	overall,	but	I	didn’t	care	about	that."
Book 2,"Everything	hinged	on	my	getting	a	50-
spot	where	it	counted	most."
Book 2,"“What	did	I	get	on	mechanical	comprehension?”	He	shrugged,	clicked	and
scrolled,	and	there	it	was."
Book 2,My	new	favorite	number	glowed	on	his	screen:	50.
Book 2,“YES!”	I	shouted.
Book 2,"“YES!	YES!”
There	was	still	a	handful	of	others	taking	the	test,	but	this	was	the	happiestmoment	in	my	life	and	I	couldn’t	stifle	it."
Book 2,"I	kept	screaming	“YES!”	at	the	top	of
my	lungs."
Book 2,"The	administrator	damn	near	fell	out	of	his	chair	and	everyone	in	that
room	stared	at	me	like	I	was	crazy."
Book 2,"If	they	only	knew	how	crazed	I’d	been!	For
two	months	I’d	dedicated	my	entire	existence	to	this	one	moment,	and	I	was
damn	well	gonna	enjoy	it."
Book 2,I	rushed	to	my	car	and	screamed	some	more.
Book 2,"“FUCK	YEAH!”
On	my	drive	home	I	called	my	mom."
Book 2,"She	was	the	one	person,	aside	from
Schaljo,	who	witnessed	my	metamorphosis."
Book 2,"“I	fucking	did	it,”	I	told	her,	tears	in
my	eyes."
Book 2,"“I	fucking	did	it!	I’m	going	to	be	a	SEAL.”
When	Schaljo	came	to	work	the	next	day,	he	got	the	news	and	called	me	up."
Book 2,"He’d	sent	in	my	recruitment	package	and	had	just	heard	back	that	I	was	in!	I
could	tell	he	was	happy	for	me,	and	proud	that	what	he	saw	in	me	the	first	time
we	met	turned	out	to	be	real."
Book 2,But	it	wasn’t	all	happy	days.
Book 2,"My	wife	had	given	me	an	implied	ultimatum,	and
now	I	had	a	decision	to	make."
Book 2,"Abandon	the	opportunity	I’d	worked	so	hard	for
and	stay	married,	or	get	divorced	and	go	try	to	become	a	SEAL."
Book 2,"In	the	end,	my
choice	didn’t	have	anything	to	do	with	my	feelings	for	Pam	or	her	father."
Book 2,"He’d
apologized	to	me,	by	the	way."
Book 2,It	was	about	who	I	was	and	who	I	wanted	to	be.
Book 2,"I
was	a	prisoner	in	my	own	my	mind	and	this	opportunity	was	my	only	chance	to
break	free."
Book 2,I	celebrated	my	victory	the	way	any	SEAL	candidate	should.
Book 2,I	put	the	fuck	out.
Book 2,"The	following	morning	and	for	the	next	three	weeks	I	spent	time	in	the	pool,
strapped	with	a	sixteen-pound	weight	belt."
Book 2,"I	swam	underwater	for	fifty	meters	at
a	time	and	walked	the	length	of	the	pool	underwater,	with	a	brick	in	each	hand,
all	on	a	single	breath."
Book 2,The	water	would	not	own	my	ass	this	time.
Book 2,"When	I	was	done,	I’d	swim	a	mile	or	two,	then	head	to	a	pond	near	my	mother’s
home."
Book 2,"Remember,	this	was	Indiana—the	American	Midwest—in	December."
Book 2,"The
trees	were	naked."
Book 2,"Icicles	hung	like	crystals	from	the	eaves	of	houses	and	snow
blanketed	the	earth	in	all	directions,	but	the	pond	wasn’t	completely	frozen	yet."
Book 2,"I
waded	into	the	icy	water,	dressed	in	camo	pants,	a	brown	short	sleeved	t-shirt,
and	boots,	laid	back	and	looked	into	the	gray	sky."
Book 2,"The	hypothermic	water
washed	over	me,	the	pain	was	excruciating,	and	I	fucking	loved	it."
Book 2,"After	a	fewminutes	I	got	out	and	started	running,	water	sloshing	in	my	boots,	sand	in	my
underwear."
Book 2,"Within	seconds	my	t-shirt	was	frozen	to	my	chest,	my	pants	iced	at
the	cuffs."
Book 2,I	hit	the	Monon	trail.
Book 2,"Steam	poured	from	my	nose	and	mouth	as	I	grunted	and
slalomed	speed-walkers	and	joggers."
Book 2,Civilians.
Book 2,"Their	heads	turned	as	I	picked	up
speed	and	began	sprinting,	like	Rocky	in	downtown	Philly."
Book 2,"I	ran	as	fast	as	I
could	for	as	long	as	I	could,	from	a	past	that	no	longer	defined	me,	toward	a
future	undetermined."
Book 2,"All	I	knew	was	that	there	would	be	pain	and	there	would
be	purpose."
Book 2,"And	that	I	was	ready.CHALLENGE	#3
The	first	step	on	the	journey	toward	a	calloused	mind	is	stepping	outside	your
comfort	zone	on	a	regular	basis."
Book 2,"Dig	out	your	journal	again	and	write	down	all
the	things	you	don’t	like	to	do	or	that	make	you	uncomfortable."
Book 2,"Especially	those
things	you	know	are	good	for	you."
Book 2,"Now	go	do	one	of	them,	and	do	it	again."
Book 2,"In	the	coming	pages,	I’ll	be	asking	you	to	mirror	what	you	just	read	to	some
degree,	but	there	is	no	need	for	you	to	find	your	own	impossible	task	and
achieve	it	on	the	fast	track."
Book 2,"This	is	not	about	changing	your	life	instantly,	it’s
about	moving	the	needle	bit	by	bit	and	making	those	changes	sustainable."
Book 2,"That
means	digging	down	to	the	micro	level	and	doing	something	that	sucks	every
day."
Book 2,"Even	if	it’s	as	simple	as	making	your	bed,	doing	the	dishes,	ironing	your
clothes,	or	getting	up	before	dawn	and	running	two	miles	each	day."
Book 2,"Once	that
becomes	comfortable,	take	it	to	five,	then	ten	miles."
Book 2,"If	you	already	do	all	those
things,	find	something	you	aren’t	doing."
Book 2,"We	all	have	areas	in	our	lives	we	either
ignore	or	can	improve	upon."
Book 2,Find	yours.

stressful	situations."
Book 2,"Take	a	photo	or	video	of	yourself	in	the	discomfort	zone,	post	it	on	social	media

4."
Book 2,"TAKING	SOULS
The	first	concussion	grenade	exploded	at	close	range,	and	from	there	everything
unraveled	in	slow	motion."
Book 2,"One	minute	we	were	chilling	in	the	common	room,
bullshitting,	watching	war	movies,	getting	pumped	up	for	the	battle	we	knew
was	coming."
Book 2,"Then	that	first	explosion	led	to	another,	and	suddenly	Psycho	Pete
was	in	our	faces,	screaming	at	the	top	of	his	lungs,	his	cheeks	flushed	candy
apple	red,	that	vein	in	his	right	temple	throbbing."
Book 2,"When	he	screamed,	his	eyes
bugged	out	and	his	whole	body	shook."
Book 2,"“Break!	The	fuck!	Out!	Move!	Move!	Move!”
My	boat	crew	sprinted	for	the	door	single-file,	just	like	we’d	planned."
Book 2,"Outside,
Navy	SEALs	were	firing	their	M60s	into	the	darkness	toward	some	invisible
enemy."
Book 2,"It	was	the	bad	dream	we’d	been	waiting	for	our	entire	lives:	the	lucid
nightmare	that	would	define	or	kill	us."
Book 2,"Every	impulse	we	had	told	us	to	hit	the
dirt,	but	at	that	moment,	movement	was	our	only	option."
Book 2,"The	repetitive,	deep	bass	thud	of	machine-gun	fire	penetrated	our	guts,	the
orange	halo	from	another	explosion	in	the	near	distance	provided	a	shock	of
violent	beauty,	and	our	hearts	hammered	as	we	gathered	on	the	Grinder	awaiting
orders."
Book 2,"This	was	war	alright,	but	it	wouldn’t	be	fought	on	some	foreign	shore."
Book 2,"This	one,	like	most	battles	we	fight	in	life,	would	be	won	or	lost	in	our	own
minds."
Book 2,"Psycho	Pete	stomped	the	pocked	asphalt,	his	brow	slick	with	sweat,	the	muzzle
of	his	rifle	steaming	in	the	foggy	night."
Book 2,"“Welcome	to	Hell	Week,	gentlemen,”	he
said,	calmly	this	time,	in	that	sing-song	Cali-surfer	drawl	of	his."
Book 2,"He	looked	us	up
and	down	like	a	predator	eyeing	his	kill."
Book 2,"“It	will	be	my	great	pleasure	to	watch
you	suffer.”
Oh,	and	there	would	be	suffering."
Book 2,"Psycho	set	the	tempo,	called	out	the	push-ups,
sit-ups,	and	flutter	kicks,	the	jumping	lunges	and	dive	bombers."
Book 2,"In	between,	heand	his	fellow	instructors	hosed	us	down	with	freezing	water,	cackling	the	whole
damn	time."
Book 2,There	were	countless	reps	and	set	after	set	with	no	end	in	sight.
Book 2,"My	classmates	were	gathered	close,	each	of	us	on	our	own	stenciled	frog
footprints,	overlooked	by	a	statue	of	our	patron	saint:	The	Frogman,	a	scaly	alien
creature	from	the	deep	with	webbed	feet	and	hands,	sharp	claws,	and	a
motherfucking	six-pack."
Book 2,To	his	left	was	the	infamous	brass	bell.
Book 2,"Ever	since	that
morning	when	I	came	home	from	cockroach	duty	and	got	sucked	into	the	Navy
SEAL	show,	it	was	this	place	that	I’d	sought."
Book 2,"The	Grinder:	a	slab	of	asphalt
dripping	with	history	and	misery."
Book 2,"Basic	Underwater	Demolition/SEAL	(BUD/S)	training	is	six	months	long	and
divided	into	three	phases."
Book 2,"First	Phase	is	all	about	physical	training,	or	PT."
Book 2,"Second	Phase	is	dive	training,	where	we	learn	how	to	navigate	underwater	and
deploy	stealthy,	closed	circuit	diving	systems	that	emit	no	bubbles	and	recycle
our	carbon	dioxide	into	breathable	air."
Book 2,Third	Phase	is	land	warfare	training.
Book 2,"But
when	most	people	picture	BUD/S	they	think	of	First	Phase	because	those	are	the
weeks	that	tenderize	new	recruits	until	the	class	is	literally	ground	down	from
about	120	guys	to	the	hard,	gleaming	spine	that	are	the	twenty-five	to	forty	guys
who	are	more	worthy	of	the	Trident."
Book 2,"The	emblem	that	tells	the	world	we	are	not
to	be	fucked	with."
Book 2,"BUD/S	instructors	do	that	by	working	guys	out	beyond	their	perceived	limits,	by
challenging	their	manhood,	and	insisting	on	objective	physical	standards	of
strength,	stamina,	and	agility."
Book 2,Standards	that	are	tested.
Book 2,"In	those	first	three	weeks
of	training	we	had	to,	among	other	things,	climb	a	vertical	ten-meter	rope,
hammer	a	half-mile-long	obstacle	course	studded	with	American	Ninja	Warrior
type	challenges	in	under	ten	minutes,	and	run	four	miles	on	the	sand	in	under
thirty-two	minutes."
Book 2,"But	if	you	ask	me,	all	that	was	child’s	play."
Book 2,"It	couldn’t	even
compare	to	the	crucible	of	First	Phase."
Book 2,Hell	Week	is	something	entirely	different.
Book 2,"It’s	medieval	and	it	comes	at	you	fast,
detonating	in	just	the	third	week	of	training."
Book 2,"When	the	throbbing	ache	in	our
muscles	and	joints	was	ratcheted	up	high	and	we	lived	day	and	night	with	an
edgy,	hyperventilating	feeling	of	our	breath	getting	out	front	of	our	physical
rhythm,	of	our	lungs	inflating	and	deflating	like	canvas	bags	squeezed	tight	in	a
demon’s	fists,	for	130	hours	straight."
Book 2,"That’s	a	test	that	goes	way	beyond	the
physical	and	reveals	your	heart	and	character."
Book 2,"More	than	anything,	it	revealsyour	mindset,	which	is	exactly	what	it’s	designed	to	do."
Book 2,"All	of	this	happened	at	the	Naval	Special	Warfare	Command	Center	on	prissy-
ass	Coronado	Island,	a	Southern	California	tourist	trap	that	tucks	into	slender
Point	Loma	and	shelters	the	San	Diego	Marina	from	the	open	Pacific	Ocean."
Book 2,"But
even	Cali’s	golden	sun	couldn’t	pretty	up	the	Grinder,	and	thank	God	for	that."
Book 2,"I
liked	it	ugly."
Book 2,That	slab	of	agony	was	everything	I’d	ever	wanted.
Book 2,"Not	because	I
loved	to	suffer,	but	because	I	needed	to	know	whether	or	not	I	had	what	it	took
to	belong."
Book 2,"Thing	is,	most	people	don’t."
Book 2,"By	the	time	Hell	Week	started,	at	least	forty	guys	had	already	quit,	and	when
they	did	they	were	forced	to	walk	over	to	the	bell,	ring	it	three	times,	and	place
their	helmet	on	the	concrete."
Book 2,"The	ringing	of	the	bell	was	first	brought	in	during
the	Vietnam	era	because	so	many	guys	were	quitting	during	evolutions	and	just
walking	off	to	the	barracks."
Book 2,"The	bell	was	a	way	to	keep	track	of	guys,	but	since
then	it’s	become	a	ritual	that	a	man	has	to	perform	to	own	the	fact	that	he’s
quitting."
Book 2,"To	the	quitter,	the	bell	is	closure."
Book 2,"To	me,	every	clang	sounded	like
progress."
Book 2,"I	never	liked	Psycho	much,	but	I	couldn’t	quibble	with	the	specifics	of	his	job."
Book 2,He	and	his	fellow	instructors	were	there	to	cull	the	herd.
Book 2,"Plus,	he	wasn’t	going
after	the	runts."
Book 2,"He	was	in	my	face	plenty,	and	guys	bigger	than	me	too."
Book 2,"Even	the
smaller	dudes	were	studs."
Book 2,"I	was	one	man	in	a	fleet	of	alpha	specimens	from	back
East	and	down	South,	the	blue-collar	and	big-money	surf	beaches	of	California,
a	few	from	corn	country	like	me,	and	plenty	from	the	Texas	rangeland."
Book 2,"Every
BUD/S	class	has	their	share	of	hard-ass	backcountry	Texans."
Book 2,"No	state	puts	more
SEALs	in	the	pipeline."
Book 2,"Must	be	something	in	the	barbecue,	but	Psycho	didn’t
play	favorites."
Book 2,"No	matter	where	we	were	from	or	who	we	were,	he	lingered	like
a	shadow	we	couldn’t	shake."
Book 2,"Laughing,	screaming,	or	quietly	taunting	us	to	our
face,	attempting	to	burrow	into	the	brain	of	any	man	he	tried	to	break."
Book 2,"Despite	all	that,	the	first	hour	of	Hell	Week	was	actually	fun."
Book 2,"During	breakout,
that	mad	rush	of	explosions,	shooting,	and	shouting,	you	are	not	even	thinking
about	the	nightmare	to	come."
Book 2,"You’re	riding	an	adrenaline	high	because	you
know	you’re	fulfilling	a	rite	of	passage	within	a	hallowed	warrior	tradition."
Book 2,"Guys
are	looking	around	the	Grinder,	practically	giddy,	thinking,	“Yeah,	we’re	in	HellWeek,	motherfuckers!”	Ah,	but	reality	has	a	way	of	kicking	everyone	in	the
teeth	sooner	or	later."
Book 2,“You	call	this	putting	out?”	Psycho	Pete	asked	no	one	in	particular.
Book 2,"“This	may
be	the	single	sorriest	class	we	ever	put	through	our	program."
Book 2,"You	men	are
straight	up	embarrassing	yourselves.”
He	relished	this	part	of	the	job."
Book 2,"Stepping	over	and	between	us,	his	boot	print	in
our	pooling	sweat	and	saliva,	snot,	tears,	and	blood."
Book 2,He	thought	he	was	hard.
Book 2,"All
the	instructors	did,	and	they	were	because	they	were	SEALs.	That	fact	alone
placed	them	in	rare	air."
Book 2,"“You	boys	couldn’t	have	held	my	jock	when	I	went
through	Hell	Week,	I’ll	tell	you	that	much.”
I	smiled	to	myself	and	kept	hammering	as	Psycho	brushed	by."
Book 2,"He	was	built	like
a	tailback,	quick	and	strong,	but	was	he	a	mortal	fucking	weapon	during	his	Hell
Week?"
Book 2,"Sir,	I	doubt	that	very	fucking	much,	sir!
He	caught	the	eye	of	his	boss,	the	First	Phase	Officer	in	Charge."
Book 2,"There	was	no
doubt	about	him."
Book 2,He	didn’t	talk	a	whole	lot	and	didn’t	have	to.
Book 2,"He	was	6’1”,	but
he	cast	a	longer	shadow."
Book 2,Dude	was	jacked	too.
Book 2,"I’m	talking	about	225	pounds	of
muscle	wrapped	tight	as	steel,	without	an	ounce	of	sympathy."
Book 2,"He	looked	like	a
Silverback	Gorilla	(SBG),	and	loomed	like	a	Godfather	of	pain,	making	silent
calculations,	taking	mental	notes."
Book 2,"“Sir,	my	dick’s	getting	stiff	just	thinking	about	these	gaping	vaginas	weeping
and	quitting	like	whiny	little	bitches	this	week,”	Psycho	said."
Book 2,"SBG	offered	half	a
nod	as	Psycho	stared	through	me."
Book 2,"“Oh,	and	you	will	quit,”	he	said	softly."
Book 2,"“I’ll
make	sure	of	that.”
Psycho’s	threats	were	spookier	when	he	delivered	them	in	a	relaxed	tone	like
that,	but	there	were	plenty	of	times	when	his	eyes	went	dark,	his	brow	twisted,
the	blood	rushed	to	his	face,	and	he	unleashed	a	scream	that	built	from	the	tips	of
his	toes	to	the	crown	of	his	bald	head."
Book 2,"An	hour	into	Hell	Week,	he	knelt	down,
pressed	his	face	within	an	inch	of	my	own	while	I	finished	another	set	of	push-
ups,	and	let	loose."
Book 2,"“Hit	the	surf,	you	miserable	fucking	turds!”We’d	been	in	BUD/S	for	nearly	three	weeks	by	then,	and	we’d	raced	up	and
over	the	fifteen-foot	berm	that	divided	the	beach	from	the	cinderblock	sprawl	of
offices,	locker	rooms,	barracks,	and	classrooms	that	is	the	BUD/S	compound
plenty	of	times."
Book 2,"Usually	to	lie	back	in	the	shallows,	fully	dressed,	then	roll	in	the
sand—until	we	were	covered	in	sand	from	head	to	toe—before	charging	back	to
the	Grinder,	dripping	heavy	with	salt	water	and	sand,	which	ramped	up	the
degree	of	difficulty	on	the	pull-up	bar."
Book 2,"That	ritual	was	called	getting	wet	and
sandy,	and	they	wanted	sand	in	our	ears,	up	our	noses,	and	in	every	orifice	of	our
body,	but	this	time	we	were	on	the	verge	of	something	called	surf	torture,	which
is	a	special	kind	of	beast."
Book 2,"As	instructed,	we	charged	into	the	surf	screaming	like	senseis."
Book 2,"Fully	clothed,
arms	linked,	we	waded	into	the	impact	zone."
Book 2,"The	surf	was	angry	that	moonless
night,	nearly	head	high,	and	the	waves	were	rolling	thunder	that	barreled	and
foamed	in	sets	of	three	and	four."
Book 2,"Cold	water	shriveled	our	balls	and	swiped	the
breath	from	our	lungs	as	the	waves	thrashed	us."
Book 2,"This	was	early	May,	and	in	the	spring	the	ocean	off	Coronado	ranges	from	59–
63	degrees."
Book 2,"We	bobbed	up	and	down	as	one,	a	pearl	strand	of	floating	heads
scanning	the	horizon	for	any	hint	of	swell	we	prayed	we’d	see	coming	before	it
towed	us	under."
Book 2,"The	surfers	in	our	crew	detected	doom	first	and	called	out	the
waves	so	we	could	duck	dive	just	in	time."
Book 2,"After	ten	minutes	or	so,	Psycho
ordered	us	back	to	land."
Book 2,"On	the	verge	of	hypothermia,	we	scrambled	from	the
surf	zone	and	stood	at	attention,	while	being	checked	by	the	doctor	for
hypothermia."
Book 2,That	cycle	would	continue	to	repeat	itself.
Book 2,"The	sky	was	smeared
orange	and	red."
Book 2,The	temperature	dropped	sharply	as	night	loomed	close.
Book 2,"“Say	goodbye	to	the	sun,	gents,”	SBG	said."
Book 2,He	made	us	wave	at	the	setting	sun.
Book 2,A	symbolic	acknowledgement	of	an	inconvenient	truth.
Book 2,"We	were	about	to	freeze
our	natural	asses	off."
Book 2,"After	an	hour,	we	fell	back	into	our	six-man	boat	crews,	and	stood	nut	to	butt,
huddling	tight	to	get	warm,	but	it	was	futile."
Book 2,"Bones	were	rattling	up	and	down
that	beach."
Book 2,"Guys	were	jackhammering	and	sniffling,	a	physical	state	revealing
the	quaking	conditions	of	splintering	minds,	which	were	just	now	coming	to
grips	with	the	reality	that	this	shit	had	only	just	begun."
Book 2,"Even	on	the	hardest	days	of	First	Phase	prior	to	Hell	Week,	when	the	sheervolume	of	rope	climbs	and	push-ups,	pull-ups,	and	flutter	kicks	crushes	your
spirit,	you	can	find	a	way	out."
Book 2,"Because	you	know	that	no	matter	how	much	it
sucks,	you’ll	head	home	that	night,	meet	friends	for	dinner,	see	a	movie,	maybe
get	some	pussy,	and	sleep	in	your	own	bed."
Book 2,"The	point	is,	even	on	miserable	days
you	can	fixate	on	an	escape	from	hell	that’s	real."
Book 2,Hell	Week	offers	no	such	love.
Book 2,"Especially	on	day	one,	when	an	hour	in	they	had
us	standing,	linking	arms,	facing	the	Pacific	Ocean,	wading	in	and	out	of	the	surf
for	hours."
Book 2,In	between	we	were	gifted	soft	sand	sprints	to	warm	up.
Book 2,"Usually	they
had	us	carry	our	rigid	inflatable	boat	or	a	log	overhead,	but	the	warmth,	if	it	ever
arrived,	was	always	short-lived	because	every	ten	minutes	they	rotated	us	back
into	the	water."
Book 2,"The	clock	ticked	slowly	that	first	night	as	the	cold	seeped	in,	colonizing	our
marrow	so	thoroughly	the	runs	stopped	doing	any	good."
Book 2,"There	would	be	no	more
bombs,	no	more	shooting,	and	very	little	yelling."
Book 2,"Instead,	an	eerie	quiet
expanded	and	deadened	our	spirit."
Book 2,"In	the	ocean,	all	any	of	us	could	hear	were	the
waves	going	overhead,	the	seawater	we	accidentally	swallowed	roiling	in	our
guts,	and	our	own	teeth	chattering."
Book 2,"When	you’re	that	cold	and	stressed,	the	mind	cannot	comprehend	the	next	120-
plus	hours."
Book 2,"Five	and	a	half	days	without	sleep	cannot	be	broken	up	into	small
pieces."
Book 2,"There	is	no	way	to	systematically	attack	it,	which	is	why	every	single
person	who	has	ever	tried	to	become	a	SEAL	has	asked	himself	one	simple
question	during	their	first	dose	of	surf	torture:
“Why	am	I	here?”
Those	innocuous	words	bubbled	up	in	our	spinning	minds	each	time	we	got
sucked	under	a	monster	wave	at	midnight,	when	we	were	already	borderline
hypothermic."
Book 2,Because	nobody	has	to	become	a	SEAL.
Book 2,"We	weren’t	fucking
drafted."
Book 2,Becoming	a	SEAL	is	a	choice.
Book 2,"And	what	that	single	softball	question
revealed	in	the	heat	of	battle	is	that	each	second	we	remained	in	training	was
also	a	choice,	which	made	the	entire	notion	of	becoming	a	SEAL	seem	like
masochism."
Book 2,It’s	voluntary	torture.
Book 2,"And	that	makes	no	sense	at	all	to	the	rational
mind,	which	is	why	those	four	words	unravel	so	many	men."
Book 2,"The	instructors	know	all	of	this,	of	course,	which	is	why	they	stop	yelling	earlyon."
Book 2,"Instead,	as	the	night	wore	on,	Psycho	Pete	consoled	us	like	a	concerned	older
brother."
Book 2,"He	offered	us	hot	soup,	a	warm	shower,	blankets,	and	a	ride	back	to	the
barracks."
Book 2,"That	was	the	bait	he	set	for	quitters	to	snap	up,	and	he	harvested
helmets	left	and	right."
Book 2,"He	was	taking	the	souls	of	those	who	caved	because	they
couldn’t	answer	that	simple	question."
Book 2,I	get	it.
Book 2,"When	it’s	only	Sunday	and	you
know	you’re	going	to	Friday	and	you’re	already	far	colder	than	you’ve	ever
been,	you’re	tempted	to	believe	that	you	can’t	hack	it	and	that	nobody	can."
Book 2,"Married	guys	were	thinking,	I	could	be	at	home,	cuddled	up	to	my	beautiful	wife
instead	of	shivering	and	suffering."
Book 2,"Single	guys	were	thinking,	I	could	be	on	the
hunt	for	pussy	right	now."
Book 2,"It’s	tough	to	ignore	that	kind	of	glittering	lure,	but	this	was	my	second	lap
through	the	early	stages	of	BUD/S."
Book 2,"I’d	tasted	the	evil	of	Hell	Week	as	part	of
Class	230."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	make	it,	but	I	didn’t	quit."
Book 2,"I	was	pulled	out	on	a	medical	after
contracting	double	pneumonia."
Book 2,"I	defied	doctor’s	orders	three	times	and	tried	to
stay	in	the	fight,	but	they	eventually	forced	me	to	the	barracks	and	rolled	me
back	to	day	one,	week	one	of	Class	231."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	all	the	way	healed	up	from	that	bout	of	pneumonia	when	my	second
BUD/S	class	kicked	off."
Book 2,"My	lungs	were	still	filled	with	mucus	and	each	cough
shook	my	chest	and	sounded	like	a	rake	was	scraping	the	inside	of	my	alveoli."
Book 2,"Still,	I	liked	my	chances	a	lot	better	this	time	around	because	I	was	prepared,	and
because	I	was	in	a	boat	crew	thick	with	bad	motherfuckers."
Book 2,"BUD/S	boat	crews	are	sorted	by	height	because	those	are	the	guys	who	will	help
you	carry	your	boat	everywhere	you	go	once	Hell	Week	begins."
Book 2,"Size	alone
didn’t	guarantee	your	teammates	would	be	tough,	however,	and	our	guys	were	a
crew	of	square-peg	misfits."
Book 2,"There	was	me,	the	exterminator	who	had	to	drop	100	pounds	and	take	the
ASVAB	test	twice	just	to	get	to	SEAL	training,	only	to	be	rolled	back	almost
immediately."
Book 2,We	also	had	the	late	Chris	Kyle.
Book 2,"You	know	him	as	the	deadliest
sniper	in	Navy	history."
Book 2,"He	was	so	successful,	the	hajjis	in	Fallujah	put	an
$80,000	bounty	on	his	head	and	he	became	a	living	legend	among	the	Marines
he	protected	as	a	member	of	Seal	Team	Three."
Book 2,"He	won	a	Silver	Star	and	four
Bronze	Stars	for	valor,	left	the	military,	and	wrote	a	book,	American	Sniper,	that
became	a	hit	movie	starring	Bradley	fucking	Cooper."
Book 2,"But	back	then	he	was	a
simple	Texas	hayseed	rodeo	cowboy	who	barely	said	a	damn	word.Then	there	was	Bill	Brown,	aka	Freak	Brown."
Book 2,"Most	people	just	called	him
Freak,	and	he	hated	it	because	he’d	been	treated	like	one	his	whole	damn	life."
Book 2,"In
many	ways	he	was	the	white	version	of	David	Goggins."
Book 2,"He	came	up	tough	in	the
river	towns	of	South	Jersey."
Book 2,"Older	kids	in	the	neighborhood	bullied	him	because
of	his	cleft	palate	or	because	he	was	slow	in	class,	which	is	how	that	nickname
stuck."
Book 2,"He	got	into	enough	fights	over	it	that	he	eventually	landed	in	a	youth
detention	center	for	a	six-month	stretch."
Book 2,"By	the	time	he	was	nineteen	he	was
living	on	his	own	in	the	hood,	trying	to	make	ends	meet	as	a	gas	station
attendant."
Book 2,It	wasn’t	working.
Book 2,He	had	no	coat	and	no	car.
Book 2,"He	commuted
everywhere	on	a	rusted	out	ten-speed	bike,	literally	freezing	his	balls	off."
Book 2,"One
day	after	work,	he	stopped	into	a	Navy	recruitment	office	because	he	knew	he
needed	structure	and	purpose,	and	some	warm	clothes."
Book 2,"They	told	him	about	the
SEALs,	and	he	was	intrigued,	but	he	couldn’t	swim."
Book 2,"Just	like	me,	he	taught
himself,	and	after	three	attempts	he	finally	passed	the	SEAL	swim	test."
Book 2,"Next	thing	he	knew,	Brown	was	in	BUD/S,	where	that	Freak	nickname	followed
him."
Book 2,"He	rocked	PT	and	sailed	through	First	Phase,	but	he	wasn’t	nearly	as	solid
in	the	classroom."
Book 2,"Navy	SEAL	dive	training	is	as	tough	intellectually	as	it	is
physically,	but	he	scraped	by	and	got	within	two	weeks	of	becoming	a	BUD/S
graduate	when,	in	one	of	his	final	land	warfare	evolutions,	he	failed	re-
assembling	his	weapon	in	a	timed	evolution	known	as	weapons	practical."
Book 2,"Brown
hit	his	targets	but	missed	the	time,	and	he	flunked	out	of	BUD/S	at	the	bitter	end."
Book 2,But	he	didn’t	give	up.
Book 2,"No	sir,	Freak	Brown	wasn’t	going	anywhere."
Book 2,"I’d	heard
stories	about	him	before	he	washed	up	with	me	in	Class	231."
Book 2,"He	had	two	chips
on	his	shoulders,	and	I	liked	him	immediately."
Book 2,"He	was	hard	as	hell	and	exactly
the	kind	of	guy	I	signed	up	to	go	to	war	with."
Book 2,"When	we	carried	our	boat	from	the
Grinder	to	the	sand	for	the	first	time,	I	made	sure	we	were	the	two	men	at	the
front,	where	the	boat	is	at	its	heaviest."
Book 2,"“Freak	Brown,”	I	shouted,	“we	will	be	the
pillars	of	Boat	Crew	Two!”	He	looked	over,	and	I	glared	back."
Book 2,"“Don’t	fucking	call	me	that,	Goggins,”	he	said	with	a	snarl."
Book 2,"“Well	don’t	you	move	out	of	position,	son!	You	and	me,	up	front,	all	fucking
week!”
“Roger	that,”	he	said.I	took	the	lead	of	Boat	Crew	Two	from	the	beginning,	and	getting	all	six	of	us
through	Hell	Week	was	my	singular	focus."
Book 2,"Everyone	fell	in	line	because	I’d
already	proven	myself,	and	not	just	on	the	Grinder."
Book 2,"In	the	days	before	Hell	Week
began	I	got	it	into	my	head	that	we	needed	to	steal	the	Hell	Week	schedule	from
our	instructors."
Book 2,"I	told	our	crew	as	much	one	night	when	we	were	hanging	in	the
classroom,	which	doubled	as	our	lounge."
Book 2,My	words	fell	on	deaf	ears.
Book 2,"A	few	guys
laughed	but	everyone	else	ignored	me	and	went	back	to	their	shallow	ass
conversations."
Book 2,I	understood	why.
Book 2,It	made	no	sense.
Book 2,"How	were	we	supposed	to	get	a	copy	of
their	shit?"
Book 2,"And	even	if	we	did,	wouldn’t	the	anticipation	make	it	worse?"
Book 2,"And
what	if	we	got	caught?"
Book 2,Was	the	reward	worth	the	risk?
Book 2,"I	believed	it	was,	because	I’d	tasted	Hell	Week."
Book 2,"Brown	and	a	few	other	guys	had
too,	and	we	knew	how	easy	it	was	to	think	about	quitting	when	confronted	with
levels	of	pain	and	exhaustion	you	didn’t	think	possible."
Book 2,"One	hundred	and	thirty
hours	of	suffering	may	as	well	be	a	thousand	when	you	know	you	can’t	sleep
and	that	there	will	be	no	relief	anytime	soon."
Book 2,And	we	knew	something	else	too.
Book 2,Hell	Week	was	a	mind	game.
Book 2,"The	instructors	used	our	suffering	to	pick	and	peel
away	our	layers,	not	to	find	the	fittest	athletes."
Book 2,To	find	the	strongest	minds.
Book 2,That’s	something	the	quitters	didn’t	understand	until	it	was	too	late.
Book 2,"Everything	in	life	is	a	mind	game!	Whenever	we	get	swept	under	by	life’s
dramas,	large	and	small,	we	are	forgetting	that	no	matter	how	bad	the	pain	gets,
no	matter	how	harrowing	the	torture,	all	bad	things	end."
Book 2,"That	forgetting	happens
the	second	we	give	control	over	our	emotions	and	actions	to	other	people,	which
can	easily	happen	when	pain	is	peaking."
Book 2,"During	Hell	Week,	the	men	who	quit
felt	like	they	were	running	on	a	treadmill	turned	way	the	fuck	up	with	no
dashboard	within	reach."
Book 2,"But,	whether	they	ever	figured	it	out	or	not,	that	was	an
illusion	they	fell	for."
Book 2,"I	went	into	Hell	Week	knowing	I	put	myself	there,	that	I	wanted	to	be	there,	and
that	I	had	all	the	tools	I	needed	to	win	this	fucked-up	game,	which	gave	me	the
passion	to	persevere	and	claim	ownership	of	the	experience."
Book 2,"It	allowed	me	to
play	hard,	bend	rules,	and	look	for	an	edge	wherever	and	whenever	I	could	until
the	horn	sounded	on	Friday	afternoon."
Book 2,"To	me	this	was	war,	and	the	enemies
were	our	instructors	who’d	blatantly	told	us	that	they	wanted	to	break	us	down
and	make	us	quit!	Having	their	schedule	in	our	heads	would	help	us	whittle	thetime	down	by	memorizing	what	came	next,	and	more	than	that,	it	would	gift	us	a
victory	going	in."
Book 2,"Which	would	give	us	something	to	latch	onto	during	Hell	Week
when	those	motherfuckers	were	beating	us	down."
Book 2,"“Yo	man,	I’m	not	playing,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“We	need	that	schedule!”
I	could	see	Kenny	Bigbee,	the	only	other	black	man	in	Class	231,	raise	an
eyebrow	from	across	the	room."
Book 2,"He’d	been	in	my	first	BUD/S	class,	and	got
injured	just	before	Hell	Week."
Book 2,Now	he	was	back	for	seconds	too.
Book 2,"“Oh	shit,”	he
said."
Book 2,"“David	Goggins	is	back	on	the	log.”
Kenny	smiled	wide	and	I	doubled	over	laughing."
Book 2,"He’d	been	in	the	instructors’
office	listening	in	when	the	doctors	were	trying	to	pull	me	out	of	my	first	Hell
Week."
Book 2,It	was	during	a	log	PT	evolution.
Book 2,"Our	boat	crews	were	carrying	logs	as	a
unit	up	and	down	the	beach,	soaked,	salty,	and	sandy	as	shit."
Book 2,"I	was	running	with
a	log	on	my	shoulders,	vomiting	blood."
Book 2,"Bloody	snot	streamed	from	my	nose	and
mouth,	and	the	instructors	periodically	grabbed	me	and	sat	me	down	nearby
because	they	thought	I	might	drop	fucking	dead."
Book 2,"But	every	time	they	turned
around	I	was	back	in	the	mix."
Book 2,Back	on	that	log.
Book 2,Kenny	kept	hearing	the	same	refrain	over	the	radio	that	night.
Book 2,"“We	need	to	get
Goggins	out	of	there,”	one	voice	said."
Book 2,"“Roger	that,	sir."
Book 2,"Goggins	is	sitting	down,”	another	voice	crackled."
Book 2,"Then	after	a
beat,	Kenny	would	hear	that	radio	chirp	again."
Book 2,"“Oh	shit,	Goggins	is	back	on	the
log."
Book 2,"I	repeat,	Goggins	is	back	on	the	log!”
Kenny	loved	telling	that	story."
Book 2,"At	5’10”	and	170	pounds,	he	was	smaller	than	I
was	and	wasn’t	on	our	boat	crew,	but	I	knew	we	could	trust	him."
Book 2,"In	fact,	there
was	nobody	better	for	the	job."
Book 2,"During	Class	231,	Kenny	was	tapped	to	keep	the
instructors’	office	clean	and	tidy,	which	meant	that	he	had	access."
Book 2,"That	night,	he
tiptoed	into	enemy	territory,	liberated	the	schedule	from	a	file,	made	a	copy,	and
slipped	it	back	into	position	before	anyone	ever	knew	it	was	missing."
Book 2,"Just	like
that	we	had	our	first	victory	before	the	biggest	mind	game	of	our	lives	had	even
begun."
Book 2,"Of	course,	knowing	something	is	coming	is	only	a	small	part	of	the	battle."
Book 2,"Because	torture	is	torture,	and	in	Hell	Week	the	only	way	to	get	to	past	it	is	to	gothrough	it."
Book 2,"With	a	look	or	a	few	words,	I	made	sure	our	guys	were	putting	out	at
all	times."
Book 2,"When	we	stood	on	the	beach	holding	our	boat	overhead,	or	running
logs	up	and	down	that	motherfucker,	we	went	hard,	and	during	surf	torture	I
hummed	the	saddest	and	most	epic	song	from	Platoon,	while	we	waded	into	the
Pacific	Ocean."
Book 2,I’ve	always	found	inspiration	in	film.
Book 2,"Rocky	helped	motivate	me	to	achieve	my
dream	of	being	invited	to	SEAL	training,	but	Platoon	would	help	me	and	my
crew	find	an	edge	during	the	dark	nights	of	Hell	Week,	when	the	instructors
were	mocking	our	pain,	telling	us	how	sorry	we	were,	and	sending	us	into	the
head-high	surf	over	and	over	again."
Book 2,"Adagio	in	Strings	was	the	score	to	one	of	my
favorite	scenes	in	Platoon	and	with	bone-chilling	fog	wrapping	all	around	us,	I
stretched	my	arms	out	like	Elias	when	he	was	getting	gunned	down	by	the	Viet
Cong,	and	sang	my	ass	off."
Book 2,"We’d	all	watched	that	movie	together	during	First
Phase,	and	my	antics	had	a	dual	effect	of	pissing	off	the	instructors	and	firing	up
my	crew."
Book 2,"Finding	moments	of	laughter	in	the	pain	and	delirium	turned	the	entire
melodramatic	experience	upside	down	for	us."
Book 2,"It	gave	us	some	control	of	our
emotions."
Book 2,"Again,	this	was	all	a	mind	game,	and	I	damn	sure	wasn’t	going	to
lose."
Book 2,"But	the	most	important	games	within	the	game	were	the	races	that	the	instructors
set	up	between	boat	crews."
Book 2,Damn	near	everything	in	BUD/S	was	a	competition.
Book 2,We’d	run	boats	and	logs	up	and	down	the	beach.
Book 2,"We	had	paddle	races,	and	we
even	did	the	damn	O-Course	carrying	a	log	or	a	boat	between	obstacles."
Book 2,"We’d
carry	them	while	balancing	on	narrow	beams,	over	spinning	logs,	and	across
rope	bridges."
Book 2,"We’d	send	it	over	the	high	wall,	and	we	dropped	it	at	the	foot	of
the	thirty-foot-high	cargo	net	while	we	climbed	up	and	over	that	damn	thing."
Book 2,"The	winning	team	was	almost	always	rewarded	with	rest	and	the	losing	teams
got	extra	beat	downs	from	Psycho	Pete."
Book 2,"They	were	ordered	to	perform	sets	of
push-ups	and	sit-ups	in	the	wet	sand,	then	do	berm	sprints,	their	bodies	quivering
with	exhaustion,	which	felt	like	failure	on	top	of	failure."
Book 2,"Psycho	let	them	know	it
too."
Book 2,He	laughed	in	their	face	as	he	hunted	quitters.
Book 2,"“You	are	absolutely	pathetic,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“I	hope	to	God	you	fucking	quit	because
if	they	allow	you	in	the	field	you’re	gonna	get	us	all	killed!”
Watching	him	berate	my	classmates	gave	me	a	dual	sensation."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	mind	him
doing	his	job,	but	he	was	a	bully,	and	I	never	liked	bullies."
Book 2,"He’d	been	coming	atme	hard	since	I	got	back	to	BUD/S,	and	early	on	I	decided	I	would	show	him
that	he	couldn’t	get	to	me."
Book 2,"Between	bouts	of	surf	torture,	when	most	guys	stand
nut	to	butt	to	transfer	heat,	body	to	body,	I	stood	apart."
Book 2,"Everyone	else	was
shivering."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	even	twitch,	and	I	saw	how	much	that	bothered	him."
Book 2,"During	Hell	Week
The	one	luxury	we	had	during	Hell	Week	was	chow."
Book 2,We	ate	like	kings.
Book 2,"We’re
talking	omelets,	roast	chicken	and	potatoes,	steak,	hot	soup,	pasta	with	meat
sauce,	all	kinds	of	fruit,	brownies,	soda,	coffee,	and	a	lot	more."
Book 2,"The	catch	is	we
had	to	run	the	mile	there	and	back,	with	that	200-pound	boat	on	our	heads."
Book 2,"I
always	left	chow	hall	with	a	peanut	butter	sandwich	tucked	in	my	wet	and	sandypocket	to	scarf	on	the	beach	when	the	instructors	weren’t	looking."
Book 2,"One	day	after
lunch,	Psycho	decided	to	give	us	a	bit	more	than	a	mile."
Book 2,"It	became	obvious	at	the
quarter	mile	marker,	when	he	picked	up	his	pace,	that	he	wasn’t	taking	us
directly	back	to	the	Grinder."
Book 2,"“You	boys	better	keep	the	fuck	up!”	he	yelled,	as	one	boat	crew	fell	back."
Book 2,"I
checked	my	guys."
Book 2,"“We	are	staying	on	this	motherfucker!	Fuck	him!”
“Roger	that,”	said	Freak	Brown."
Book 2,"True	to	his	word,	he’d	been	with	me	on	the
front	of	that	boat—the	two	heaviest	points—since	Sunday	night,	and	he	was
only	getting	stronger."
Book 2,Psycho	stretched	us	out	on	the	soft	sand	for	more	than	four	miles.
Book 2,"He	tried	like
hell	to	lose	us,	too,	but	we	were	his	shadow."
Book 2,He	switched	up	the	cadence.
Book 2,"One
minute	he	was	sprinting,	then	he	was	crouching	down,	wide-legged,	grabbing	his
nuts	and	doing	elephant	walks,	then	he	loped	at	a	jogger’s	pace	before	breaking
into	another	wind	sprint	down	the	beach."
Book 2,"By	then	the	closest	boat	was	a	quarter
mile	behind,	but	we	were	clipping	his	damn	heels."
Book 2,"We	mimicked	his	every	step
and	refused	to	let	our	bully	gain	any	satisfaction	at	our	expense."
Book 2,"He	may	have
smoked	everybody	else	but	he	did	not	smoke	Boat	Crew	Two!
Hell	Week	is	the	devil’s	opera,	and	it	builds	like	a	crescendo,	peaking	in	torment
on	Wednesday	and	staying	right	there	until	they	call	it	on	Friday	afternoon."
Book 2,"By
Wednesday	we	were	all	broke	dick,	chafed	to	holy	Hell."
Book 2,"Our	whole	body	was
one	big	raspberry,	oozing	puss	and	blood."
Book 2,Mentally	we	were	zombies.
Book 2,"The
instructors	had	us	doing	simple	boat	raises	and	we	were	all	dragging."
Book 2,"Even	my
crew	could	barely	lift	that	boat."
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	Psycho	and	SBG	and	the	other
instructors	kept	close	watch,	looking	for	weaknesses	as	always."
Book 2,I	had	a	real	hate	for	the	instructors.
Book 2,"They	were	my	enemy	and	I	was	tired	of	them
trying	to	burrow	into	my	brain."
Book 2,"I	glanced	at	Brown,	and	for	the	first	time	all
week	he	looked	shaky."
Book 2,The	whole	crew	did.
Book 2,"Shit,	I	felt	miserable	too."
Book 2,"My	knee
was	the	size	of	a	grapefruit	and	every	step	I	took	torched	my	nerves,	which	is
why	I	was	searching	for	something	to	fuel	me."
Book 2,I	locked	in	on	Psycho	Pete.
Book 2,"I	was
sick	of	that	motherfucker."
Book 2,The	instructors	looked	composed	and	comfortable.
Book 2,"We	were	desperate,	and	they	had	what	we	needed:	energy!	It	was	time	to	flip	thegame	and	own	real	estate	in	their	heads."
Book 2,"When	they	clocked	out	that	night	and	drove	home	after	a	pussy-ass	eight	hour
shift	while	we	were	still	going	hard,	I	wanted	them	thinking	about	Boat	Crew
Two."
Book 2,I	wanted	to	haunt	them	when	they	slipped	into	bed	with	their	wives.
Book 2,"I
wanted	to	occupy	so	much	space	in	their	minds	that	they	couldn’t	even	get	it	up."
Book 2,To	me	that	would	be	as	powerful	as	putting	a	knife	in	their	dick.
Book 2,"So	I	deployed	a
process	that	I	now	call	“Taking	Souls.”
I	turned	to	Brown."
Book 2,“You	know	why	I	call	you	Freak?”	I	asked.
Book 2,"He	looked	over
as	we	lowered	the	boat,	then	lifted	it	up	overhead	like	creaky	robots	on	reserve
battery	power."
Book 2,"“Because	you	are	one	of	the	baddest	men	I’ve	ever	seen	in	my
damn	life!”	He	cracked	a	smile."
Book 2,"“And	you	know	what	I	say	to	these
motherfuckers	right	here?”	I	tipped	my	elbow	at	the	nine	instructors	gathered	on
the	beach,	drinking	coffee	and	talking	bullshit."
Book 2,"“I	say,	they	can	go	fuck
themselves!”	Bill	nodded	and	narrowed	his	eyes	on	our	tormentors,	while	I
turned	to	the	rest	of	the	crew."
Book 2,"“Now	let’s	throw	this	shit	up	high	and	show	them
who	we	are!”
“Fucking	beautiful,”	Bill	said."
Book 2,"“Let’s	do	it!”
Within	seconds	my	whole	team	had	life."
Book 2,"We	didn’t	just	lift	the	boat	overhead
and	set	it	down	hard,	we	threw	it	up,	caught	it	overhead,	tapped	the	sand	with	it
and	threw	it	up	high	again."
Book 2,The	results	were	immediate	and	undeniable.
Book 2,"Our	pain
and	exhaustion	faded."
Book 2,"Each	rep	made	us	stronger	and	faster,	and	each	time	we
threw	the	boat	up	we	all	chanted."
Book 2,"“YOU	CAN’T	HURT	BOAT	CREW	TWO!”
That	was	our	fuck	you	to	the	instructors,	and	we	had	their	full	attention	as	we
soared	on	a	second	wind."
Book 2,"On	the	toughest	day	of	the	hardest	week	in	the	world’s
toughest	training,	Boat	Crew	Two	was	moving	at	lightning	speed	and	making	a
mockery	of	Hell	Week."
Book 2,The	look	on	the	instructors’	faces	told	a	story.
Book 2,"Their
mouths	hung	open	like	they	were	witnessing	something	nobody	had	ever	seen
before."
Book 2,"Some	averted	their	eyes,	almost	embarrassed."
Book 2,"Only	SBG	looked
satisfied."
Book 2,"***Since	that	night	in	Hell	Week,	I’ve	deployed	the	Taking	Souls	concept	countless
times."
Book 2,"Taking	Souls	is	a	ticket	to	finding	your	own	reserve	power	and	riding	a
second	wind."
Book 2,"It’s	the	tool	you	can	call	upon	to	win	any	competition	or	overcome
every	life	obstacle."
Book 2,"You	can	utilize	it	to	win	a	chess	match,	or	conquer	an
adversary	in	a	game	of	office	politics."
Book 2,"It	can	help	you	rock	a	job	interview	or
excel	at	school."
Book 2,"And	yes,	it	can	be	used	to	conquer	all	manner	of	physical
challenges,	but	remember,	this	is	a	game	you	are	playing	within	yourself."
Book 2,"Unless
you’re	engaged	in	physical	competition,	I’m	not	suggesting	that	you	try	to
dominate	someone	or	crush	their	spirit."
Book 2,"In	fact,	they	never	even	need	to	know
you’re	playing	this	game."
Book 2,This	is	a	tactic	for	you	to	be	your	best	when	duty	calls.
Book 2,It’s	a	mind	game	you’re	playing	on	yourself.
Book 2,Taking	someone’s	soul	means	you’ve	gained	a	tactical	advantage.
Book 2,"Life	is	all
about	looking	for	tactical	advantages,	which	is	why	we	stole	the	Hell	Week
schedule,	why	we	nipped	Psycho’s	heels	on	that	run,	and	why	I	made	a	show	of
myself	in	the	surf,	humming	the	Platoon	theme	song."
Book 2,"Each	of	those	incidents
was	an	act	of	defiance	that	empowered	us."
Book 2,But	defiance	isn’t	always	the	best	way	to	take	someone’s	soul.
Book 2,"It	all	depends
upon	your	terrain."
Book 2,"During	BUD/S,	the	instructors	didn’t	mind	if	you	looked	for
advantages	like	that."
Book 2,They	respected	it	as	long	as	you	were	also	kicking	ass.
Book 2,"You
must	do	your	own	homework."
Book 2,"Know	the	terrain	you’re	operating	in,	when	and
where	you	can	push	boundaries,	and	when	you	should	fall	in	line."
Book 2,"Next,	take	inventory	of	your	mind	and	body	on	the	eve	of	battle."
Book 2,"List	out	your
insecurities	and	weakness,	as	well	as	your	opponent’s."
Book 2,"For	instance,	if	you’re
getting	bullied,	and	you	know	where	you	fall	short	or	feel	insecure,	you	can	stay
ahead	of	any	insults	or	barbs	a	bully	may	throw	your	way."
Book 2,"You	can	laugh	at
yourself	along	with	them,	which	disempowers	them."
Book 2,"If	you	take	what	they	do	or
say	less	personally,	they	no	longer	hold	any	cards."
Book 2,Feelings	are	just	feelings.
Book 2,"On
the	other	hand,	people	who	are	secure	with	themselves	don’t	bully	other	people."
Book 2,"They	look	out	for	other	people,	so	if	you’re	getting	bullied	you	know	that	you’re
dealing	with	someone	who	has	problem	areas	you	can	exploit	or	soothe."
Book 2,Sometimes	the	best	way	to	defeat	a	bully	is	to	actually	help	them.
Book 2,"If	you	can
think	two	or	three	moves	ahead,	you	will	commandeer	their	thought	process,	and
if	you	do	that,	you’ve	taken	their	damn	soul	without	them	even	realizing	it."
Book 2,"Our	SEAL	instructors	were	our	bullies,	and	they	didn’t	realize	the	games	I	wasplaying	during	that	week	to	keep	Boat	Crew	Two	sharp."
Book 2,And	they	didn’t	have	to.
Book 2,"I	imagined	that	they	were	obsessed	with	our	exploits	during	Hell	Week,	but	I
don’t	know	that	for	sure."
Book 2,"It	was	a	ploy	I	used	to	maintain	my	mental	edge	and
help	our	crew	prevail."
Book 2,"In	the	same	way,	if	you	are	up	against	a	competitor	for	a	promotion,	and	you
know	where	you	fall	short,	you	can	shape	up	your	game	ahead	of	your	interview
or	evaluation."
Book 2,"In	that	scenario,	laughing	at	your	weaknesses	won’t	solve	the
problem."
Book 2,You	must	master	them.
Book 2,"In	the	meantime,	if	you	are	aware	of	your
competitor’s	vulnerabilities	you	can	spin	those	to	your	advantage,	but	all	of	that
takes	research."
Book 2,"Again,	know	the	terrain,	know	yourself,	and	you’d	better	know
your	adversary	in	detail."
Book 2,"Once	you’re	in	the	heat	of	battle,	it	comes	down	to	staying	power."
Book 2,"If	it’s	a
difficult	physical	challenge	you	will	probably	have	to	defeat	your	own	demons
before	you	can	take	your	opponent’s	soul."
Book 2,"That	means	rehearsing	answers	to	the
simple	question	that	is	sure	to	rise	up	like	a	thought	bubble:	“Why	am	I	here?”	If
you	know	that	moment	is	coming	and	have	your	answer	ready,	you	will	be
equipped	to	make	the	split	second-decision	to	ignore	your	weakened	mind	and
keep	moving."
Book 2,"Know	why	you’re	in	the	fight	to	stay	in	the	fight!
And	never	forget	that	all	emotional	and	physical	anguish	is	finite!	It	all	ends
eventually."
Book 2,Smile	at	pain	and	watch	it	fade	for	at	least	a	second	or	two.
Book 2,"If	you
can	do	that,	you	can	string	those	seconds	together	and	last	longer	than	your
opponent	thinks	you	can,	and	that	may	be	enough	to	catch	a	second	wind."
Book 2,"There
is	no	scientific	consensus	on	second	wind."
Book 2,"Some	scientists	think	it’s	the	result	of
endorphins	flooding	your	nervous	system,	others	think	it’s	a	burst	of	oxygen	that
can	help	break	down	lactic	acid,	as	well	as	the	glycogen	and	triglycerides
muscles	need	to	perform."
Book 2,Some	say	its	purely	psychological.
Book 2,"All	I	know	is	that
by	going	hard	when	we	felt	defeated	we	were	able	to	ride	a	second	wind	through
the	worst	night	in	Hell	Week."
Book 2,"And	once	you	have	that	second	wind	behind	you
it’s	easy	to	break	your	opponent	down	and	snatch	a	soul."
Book 2,"The	hard	part	is	getting
to	that	point,	because	the	ticket	to	victory	often	comes	down	to	bringing	your
very	best	when	you	feel	your	worst."
Book 2,"***
After	rocking	boat	presses,	the	whole	class	was	gifted	an	hour	of	sleep	in	a	biggreen	army	tent	they’d	set	up	on	the	beach	and	outfitted	with	military	cots."
Book 2,"Those	motherfuckers	had	no	mattresses,	but	may	as	well	have	been	a	cotton
topped	cloud	of	luxury	because	once	we	were	horizontal	we	all	went	limp."
Book 2,"Oh,	but	Psycho	wasn’t	done	with	me."
Book 2,"He	let	me	sleep	for	a	solitary	minute,	then
woke	me	up	and	led	me	back	onto	the	beach	for	some	one-on-one	time."
Book 2,"He	saw
an	opportunity	to	get	in	my	head,	at	last,	and	I	was	disoriented	as	I	staggered
toward	the	water	all	alone,	but	the	cold	woke	me	the	fuck	up."
Book 2,"I	decided	to	savor
my	extra	hour	of	private	surf	torture."
Book 2,"When	the	water	was	chest	high	I	began
humming	Adagio	in	Strings	once	more."
Book 2,Louder	this	time.
Book 2,"Loud	enough	for	that
motherfucker	to	hear	me	over	the	crash	of	the	surf."
Book 2,"That	song	gave	me	life!
I’d	come	to	SEAL	training	to	see	if	I	was	hard	enough	to	belong	and	found	an
inner	beast	within	that	I	never	knew	existed."
Book 2,"A	beast	that	I	would	tap	into	from
then	on	whenever	life	went	wrong."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	emerged	from	that	ocean,	I
considered	myself	unbreakable."
Book 2,If	only.
Book 2,"Hell	Week	takes	its	toll	on	everybody,	and	later	that	night,	with	forty-eight	hours
to	go,	I	went	to	med	check	to	get	a	Toradol	shot	in	my	knee	to	bring	the	swelling
down."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	was	back	on	the	beach,	the	boat	crews	were	out	at	sea	in	the
midst	of	a	paddling	drill."
Book 2,"The	surf	was	pounding,	the	wind	swirling."
Book 2,"Psycho
looked	over	at	SBG."
Book 2,"“What	the	fuck	are	we	gonna	do	with	him?”
For	the	first	time,	he	was	hesitant,	and	tired	of	trying	to	beat	me	down."
Book 2,"I	was
good	to	go,	ready	for	any	challenge,	but	Psycho	was	over	it."
Book 2,"He	was	ready	to
give	my	ass	a	spa	vacation."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	knew	I’d	outlasted	him;	that	I	had	his
soul."
Book 2,SBG	had	other	ideas.
Book 2,"He	handed	me	a	life	jacket	and	attached	a	chem	light
to	the	back	of	my	hat."
Book 2,"“Follow	me,”	he	said	as	he	charged	up	the	beach."
Book 2,"I	caught	up	and	we	ran	north
for	a	good	mile."
Book 2,"By	then	we	could	barely	see	the	boats	and	their	bobbing	lights
through	the	mist	and	over	the	waves."
Book 2,"“All	right,	Goggins."
Book 2,"Now	go	swim	out	and
find	your	fucking	boat!”
He’d	landed	a	hollow	point	on	my	deepest	insecurity,	pierced	my	confidence,
and	I	was	stunned	silent."
Book 2,"I	gave	him	a	look	that	said,	“Are	you	fucking	kiddingme?”	I	was	a	decent	swimmer	by	then,	and	surf	torture	didn’t	scare	me	because
we	weren’t	that	far	from	shore,	but	an	open	water,	hypothermic	swim	a	thousand
yards	off	shore	in	a	storm,	to	a	boat	that	had	no	fucking	idea	I	was	heading	their
way?"
Book 2,"That	sounded	like	a	death	sentence,	and	I	hadn’t	prepared	for	anything	like
it."
Book 2,"But	sometimes	the	unexpected	descends	like	chaos,	and	without	warning	even
the	bravest	among	us	must	be	ready	to	take	on	risks	and	tasks	that	seem	beyond
our	capabilities."
Book 2,"For	me,	in	that	moment,	it	came	down	to	how	I	wanted	to	be	remembered."
Book 2,"I
could	have	refused	the	order,	and	I	wouldn’t	have	gotten	in	trouble	because	I	had
no	swim	buddy	(in	SEAL	training	you	always	have	to	be	with	a	swim	buddy),
and	it	was	obvious	that	he	was	asking	me	to	do	something	that	was	extremely
unsafe."
Book 2,"But	I	also	knew	that	my	objective	coming	into	SEAL	training	was	more
than	making	it	through	to	the	other	side	with	a	Trident."
Book 2,"For	me	it	was	the
opportunity	to	go	up	against	the	best	of	the	best	and	distance	myself	from	the
pack."
Book 2,"So	even	though	I	couldn’t	see	the	boats	out	past	the	thrashing	waves	there
was	no	time	to	dwell	on	fear."
Book 2,There	was	no	choice	to	make	at	all.
Book 2,“What	are	you	waiting	on	Goggins?
Book 2,"Get	your	fucking	ass	out	there,	and	do	not
fuck	this	up!”
“Roger	that!”	I	shouted	and	sprinted	into	the	surf."
Book 2,"Trouble	was,	strapped	with	a
buoyancy	vest,	nursing	a	wounded	knee,	wearing	boots,	I	couldn’t	swim	for	shit
and	it	was	almost	impossible	to	duck	dive	through	the	waves."
Book 2,"I	had	to	flail	over
the	white	wash,	and	with	my	mind	managing	so	many	variables,	the	ocean
seemed	colder	than	ever."
Book 2,I	swallowed	water	by	the	gallon.
Book 2,"It	was	as	if	the	sea
was	prying	open	my	jaws	and	flooding	my	system,	and	with	each	gulp,	my	fear
magnified."
Book 2,"I	had	no	idea	that	back	on	land,	SBG	was	preparing	for	a	worst-case	scenario
rescue."
Book 2,I	didn’t	know	he’d	never	put	another	man	in	that	position	before.
Book 2,"I	didn’t
realize	that	he	saw	something	special	in	me	and	like	any	strong	leader	wanted	to
see	how	far	I	could	take	it,	as	he	watched	my	light	bob	on	the	surface,	nervous	as
hell."
Book 2,He	told	me	all	of	that	during	a	recent	conversation.
Book 2,"At	the	time	I	was	just
trying	to	survive."
Book 2,"I	finally	made	it	through	the	surf	and	swam	another	half-mile	off-shore	only	to
realize	I	had	six	boats	bearing	down	on	my	head,	teeter	tottering	in	and	out	ofview	thanks	to	a	four-foot	wind	swell."
Book 2,"They	didn’t	know	I	was	there!	My	light
was	faint,	and	in	the	trench	I	couldn’t	see	a	damn	thing."
Book 2,"I	kept	waiting	for	one	of
them	to	come	barreling	down	from	the	peak	of	a	swell	and	mow	me	the	fuck
down."
Book 2,All	I	could	do	was	bark	into	the	darkness	like	a	hoarse	sea	lion.
Book 2,"“Boat	Crew	Two!	Boat	Crew	Two!”
It	was	a	minor	miracle	that	my	guys	heard	me."
Book 2,"They	wheeled	our	boat	around,
and	Freak	Brown	grabbed	me	with	his	big	ass	hooks	and	hauled	me	in	like	a
prized	catch."
Book 2,"I	lay	back	in	the	middle	of	the	boat,	my	eyes	closed,	and
jackhammered	for	the	first	time	all	week."
Book 2,I	was	so	cold	I	couldn’t	hide	it.
Book 2,"“Damn,	Goggins,”	Brown	said,	“you	must	be	insane!	You	okay?”	I	nodded	once
and	got	a	hold	of	myself."
Book 2,"I	was	the	leader	of	that	crew	and	couldn’t	allow	myself
to	show	weakness."
Book 2,"I	tensed	every	muscle	in	my	body,	and	my	shiver	slowed	to	a
stop	in	real	time."
Book 2,"“That’s	how	you	lead	from	the	motherfucking	front,”	I	said,	coughing	up
saltwater	like	a	wounded	bird."
Book 2,I	couldn’t	keep	a	straight	face	for	long.
Book 2,"Neither
could	my	crew."
Book 2,They	knew	damn	well	that	crazy-ass	swim	wasn’t	my	idea.
Book 2,"As	the	clock	ran	down	on	Hell	Week,	we	were	in	the	demo	pit,	just	off
Coronado’s	famous	Silver	Strand."
Book 2,"The	pit	was	filled	with	cold	mud	and	topped
off	with	icy	water."
Book 2,"There	was	a	rope	bridge—two	separate	lines,	one	for	the	feet
and	one	for	the	hands—stretching	across	it	from	end	to	end."
Book 2,"One	by	one,	each
man	had	to	navigate	their	way	across	while	the	instructors	shook	the	shit	out	of
it,	trying	to	make	us	fall."
Book 2,"To	maintain	that	kind	of	balance	takes	tremendous	core
strength,	and	we	were	all	cooked	and	at	our	wits	end."
Book 2,"Plus,	my	knee	was	still
fucked."
Book 2,"In	fact,	it	had	gotten	worse	and	required	a	pain	shot	every	twelve	hours."
Book 2,"But	when	my	name	was	called,	I	climbed	onto	that	rope,	and	when	the
instructors	went	to	work,	I	flexed	my	core	and	held	on	with	all	I	had	left."
Book 2,"Nine	months	earlier,	I	had	topped	out	at	297	pounds	and	couldn’t	even	run	a
quarter	mile."
Book 2,"Back	then,	when	I	was	dreaming	of	a	different	life,	I	remember
thinking	that	just	getting	through	Hell	Week	would	be	the	biggest	honor	of	my
life	so	far."
Book 2,"Even	if	I	never	graduated	from	BUD/S,	surviving	Hell	Week	alone
would	have	meant	something."
Book 2,But	I	didn’t	just	survive.
Book 2,"I	was	about	to	finish	Hell
Week	at	the	top	of	my	class,	and	for	the	first	time,	I	knew	I	was	a	badmotherfucker."
Book 2,"Once,	I	was	so	focused	on	failing,	I	was	afraid	to	even	try."
Book 2,"Now	I	would	take	on
any	challenge."
Book 2,"All	my	life,	I	was	terrified	of	water,	and	especially	cold	water,	but
standing	there	in	the	final	hour,	I	wished	the	ocean,	wind,	and	mud	were	even
colder!	I	was	completely	transformed	physically,	which	was	a	big	part	of	my
success	in	BUD/S,	but	what	saw	me	through	Hell	Week	was	my	mind,	and	I	was
just	starting	to	tap	into	its	power."
Book 2,"That’s	what	I	was	thinking	about	as	the	instructors	did	their	best	to	throw	me	off
that	rope	bridge	like	a	mechanical	bull."
Book 2,"I	hung	tough	and	got	as	far	as	anyone
else	in	Class	231	before	nature	won	out	and	I	was	sent	spinning	into	the	freezing
mud."
Book 2,"I	wiped	it	from	my	eyes	and	mouth	and	laughed	like	mad	as	Freak	Brown
helped	me	up."
Book 2,"Not	long	after	that,	SBG	stepped	to	the	edge	of	the	pit."
Book 2,"“Hell	Week	secure!”	He	shouted	to	the	thirty	guys	still	left,	quivering	in	the
shallows."
Book 2,"All	of	us	chafed	and	bleeding,	bloated	and	stiff."
Book 2,"“You	guys	did	an
amazing	job!”
Some	guys	screamed	with	joy."
Book 2,"Others	collapsed	to	their	knees	with	tears	in	their
eyes	and	thanked	God."
Book 2,"I	stared	into	the	heavens	too,	pulled	Freak	Brown	in	for	a
hug,	and	high-fived	my	team."
Book 2,"Every	other	boat	crew	had	lost	men,	but	not	Boat
Crew	Two!	We	lost	no	men	and	won	every	single	race!
We	continued	to	celebrate	as	we	boarded	a	bus	to	the	Grinder."
Book 2,"Once	we	arrived,
there	was	a	large	pizza	for	each	guy	along	with	a	sixty-four-ounce	bottle	of
Gatorade	and	the	coveted	brown	t-shirt."
Book 2,"That	pizza	tasted	like	motherfucking
manna	from	heaven,	but	the	shirts	meant	something	more	significant."
Book 2,"When	you
first	arrive	at	BUD/S	you	wear	white	t-shirts	every	day."
Book 2,"Once	you	survive	Hell
Week,	you	get	to	swap	them	out	for	brown	shirts."
Book 2,"It	was	a	symbol	that	we’d
advanced	to	a	higher	level,	and	after	a	lifetime	of	mostly	failure,	I	definitely	felt
like	I	was	someplace	new."
Book 2,"I	tried	to	enjoy	the	moment	like	everyone	else,	but	my	knee	hadn’t	felt	right	in
two	days	and	I	decided	to	leave	and	see	the	medics."
Book 2,"On	my	way	off	the	Grinder,
I	looked	to	my	right	and	saw	nearly	a	hundred	helmets	lined	up."
Book 2,"They	belonged
to	the	men	who’d	rung	the	bell,	and	they	stretched	past	the	statue,	all	the	way	to
the	quarterdeck."
Book 2,I	read	some	of	the	names—guys	who	I	liked.
Book 2,I	knew	how	theyfelt	because	I	was	there	when	my	Pararescue	class	graduated	without	me.
Book 2,"That
memory	had	dominated	me	for	years,	but	after	130	hours	of	Hell,	it	no	longer
defined	me."
Book 2,"Every	man	was	required	to	see	the	medics	that	evening,	but	our	bodies	were	so
swollen	they	had	a	hard	time	discerning	injuries	from	general	soreness."
Book 2,"All	I
knew	was	my	right	knee	was	thrice	fucked	and	I	needed	crutches	to	get	around."
Book 2,Freak	Brown	left	med	check	bruised	and	battered.
Book 2,"Kenny	came	out	clean	and
barely	limped,	but	he	was	plenty	sore."
Book 2,"Thankfully,	our	next	evolution	was	walk
week."
Book 2,"We	had	seven	days	to	eat,	drink,	and	heal	up	before	shit	got	real	once
again."
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	much,	but	enough	time	for	most	of	the	insane	motherfuckers	that
managed	to	remain	in	Class	231	to	get	well."
Book 2,"Me,	on	the	other	hand?"
Book 2,"My	swollen	knee	hadn’t	gotten	any	better	by	the	time
they	snatched	my	crutches	away."
Book 2,But	there	was	no	time	for	boo-hoo-ing.
Book 2,"First
Phase	fun	wasn’t	over	yet."
Book 2,"After	walk	week	came	knot	tying,	which	may	not
sound	like	much	but	was	way	worse	than	I	expected	because	that	particular	drill
took	place	at	the	bottom	of	the	pool,	where	those	same	instructors	would	do	their
best	to	drown	my	one-legged	ass."
Book 2,"It	was	as	if	the	Devil	had	been	watching	the	whole	show,	waited	out
intermission,	and	now	his	favorite	part	was	coming	right	up."
Book 2,"The	night	before
BUD/S	kicked	back	up	in	intensity	I	could	hear	his	words	ringing	in	my
stressed-out	brain	as	I	tossed	and	turned	all	night	long."
Book 2,"They	say	you	like	suffering,	Goggins."
Book 2,That	you	think	you’re	a	bad	motherfucker.
Book 2,"Enjoy	your	extended	stay	in	Hell!CHALLENGE	#4
Choose	any	competitive	situation	that	you’re	in	right	now."
Book 2,"Who	is	your
opponent?"
Book 2,"Is	it	your	teacher	or	coach,	your	boss,	an	unruly	client?"
Book 2,"No	matter
how	they’re	treating	you	there	is	one	way	to	not	only	earn	their	respect,	but	turn
the	tables."
Book 2,Excellence.
Book 2,"That	may	mean	acing	an	exam,	or	crafting	an	ideal	proposal,	or	smashing	a	sales
goal."
Book 2,"Whatever	it	is,	I	want	you	to	work	harder	on	that	project	or	in	that	class
than	you	ever	have	before."
Book 2,"Do	everything	exactly	as	they	ask,	and	whatever
standard	they	set	as	an	ideal	outcome,	you	should	be	aiming	to	surpass	that."
Book 2,"If	your	coach	doesn’t	give	you	time	in	the	games,	dominate	practice."
Book 2,"Check	the
best	guy	on	your	squad	and	show	the	fuck	out."
Book 2,"That	means	putting	time	in	off
the	field."
Book 2,"Watching	film	so	you	can	study	your	opponent’s	tendencies,
memorizing	plays,	and	training	in	the	gym."
Book 2,"You	need	to	make	that	coach	pay
attention."

knee	was	fucked,	and	that	the	odds	of	getting	through	another	five	months	of
training	on	one	leg	were	low,	but	accepting	another	roll	back	meant	enduring

Book 2,"Of	all	the	moments	in	BUD/S	that	I	thought	could	break	me,	a	knot-tying
exercise	never	registered	on	my	radar."
Book 2,"Then	again,	this	wasn’t	the	fucking	Boy
Scouts."
Book 2,"This	was	an	underwater	knot-tying	drill	held	in	the	fifteen-foot	section	of
the	pool."
Book 2,"And	while	the	pool	didn’t	strike	mortal	fear	into	me	like	it	once	did,
being	negatively	buoyant,	I	knew	that	any	pool	evolution	could	be	my	undoing,
especially	those	that	demanded	treading	water."
Book 2,"Even	before	Hell	Week,	we’d	been	tested	in	the	pool."
Book 2,"We	had	to	perform	mock
rescues	on	the	instructors	and	do	a	fifty-meter	underwater	swim	without	fins	on
a	single	breath."
Book 2,"That	swim	started	with	a	giant	stride	into	the	water	followed	by	a
full	somersault	to	siphon	off	any	momentum	whatsoever."
Book 2,"Then	without	kicking
off	the	side,	we	swam	along	the	lane	lines	to	the	end	of	our	twenty-five-meter
pool."
Book 2,On	the	far	side	we	were	allowed	to	kick	off	the	wall	then	swim	back.
Book 2,"When
I	arrived	at	the	fifty-meter	mark	I	rose	up	and	gasped	for	air."
Book 2,"My	heart
hammered	until	my	breath	smoothed,	and	I	grasped	that	I’d	actually	passed	the
first	of	a	series	of	complicated	underwater	evolutions	that	were	supposed	to
teach	us	to	be	calm,	cool,	and	collected	underwater	on	a	breath	hold."
Book 2,"The	knot-tying	evolution	was	next	in	the	series	and	it	wasn’t	about	our	ability	to
tie	various	knots	or	a	way	to	time	our	max	breath	hold."
Book 2,"Sure,	both	skills	come	in
handy	on	amphibian	operations,	but	this	drill	was	more	about	our	capacity	to
juggle	multiple	stressors	in	an	environment	that’s	not	sustainable	for	human	life."
Book 2,"Despite	my	health,	I	was	heading	into	the	drill	with	some	confidence."
Book 2,"Things
changed	when	I	started	treading	water."
Book 2,"That’s	how	the	drill	began,	with	eight	students	strung	out	across	the	pool,
moving	our	hands	and	legs	like	egg	beaters."
Book 2,"That’s	hard	enough	for	me	on	two
good	legs,	but	because	my	right	knee	didn’t	work,	I	was	forced	to	tread	water
with	just	my	left."
Book 2,"That	spiked	the	degree	of	difficulty,	and	my	heart	rate,	which
sapped	my	energy.Each	student	had	an	instructor	assigned	to	them	for	this	evolution	and	Psycho
Pete	specifically	requested	me."
Book 2,"It	was	obvious	I	was	struggling,	and	Psycho,	and
his	bruised	pride,	were	hungry	for	a	little	payback."
Book 2,"With	each	revolution	of	my
right	leg,	shockwaves	of	pain	exploded	like	fireworks."
Book 2,"Even	with	Psycho
eyeballing	me,	I	couldn’t	hide	it."
Book 2,"When	I	grimaced,	he	smiled	like	a	kid	on
Christmas	morning."
Book 2,“Tie	a	square	knot!	Then	a	bowline!”	He	shouted.
Book 2,"I	was	working	so	hard	it	was
difficult	to	catch	my	breath,	but	Psycho	didn’t	give	two	fucks."
Book 2,"“Now,	dammit!”	I
gulped	air,	bent	from	the	waist	and	kicked	down."
Book 2,"There	were	five	knots	in	the	drill	altogether	and	each	student	was	told	to	grab
their	eight-inch	slice	of	rope,	and	tie	them	off	one	at	a	time	at	the	bottom	of	the
pool."
Book 2,"We	were	allotted	a	breath	in	between,	but	could	do	as	many	as	all	five
knots	on	a	single	breath."
Book 2,"The	instructor	called	out	the	knots,	but	the	pacing	was
up	to	each	student."
Book 2,"We	weren’t	allowed	to	use	a	mask	or	goggles	to	complete	the
evolution,	and	the	instructor	had	to	approve	each	knot	with	a	thumbs	up	before
we	were	permitted	to	surface."
Book 2,"If	they	flashed	a	thumb	down	instead,	we	had	to
re-tie	that	knot	correctly,	and	if	we	surfaced	before	a	given	knot	was	approved,
that	meant	failure	and	a	ticket	home."
Book 2,"Once	back	at	the	surface,	there	was	no	resting	or	relaxing	between	tasks."
Book 2,"Treading	water	was	the	constant	refrain,	which	meant	soaring	heart	rates	and	the
continual	burning	up	of	oxygen	in	the	bloodstream	for	the	one-legged	man."
Book 2,"Translation:	the	dives	were	uncomfortable	as	hell,	and	blacking	out	was	a	real
possibility."
Book 2,Psycho	glared	at	me	through	his	mask	as	I	worked	my	knots.
Book 2,"After	about	thirty
seconds	he’d	approved	both	and	we	surfaced."
Book 2,"He	breathed	free	and	easy,	but	I
was	gasping	and	panting	like	a	wet,	tired	dog."
Book 2,"The	pain	in	my	knee	was	so	bad	I
felt	sweat	bead	up	on	my	forehead."
Book 2,"When	you’re	sweating	in	an	unheated	pool,
you	know	shit’s	fucked	up."
Book 2,"I	was	breathless,	low	on	energy,	and	wanted	to	quit,
but	quitting	this	evolution	meant	quitting	BUD/S	altogether,	and	that	wasn’t
happening."
Book 2,"“Oh	no,	are	you	hurt,	Goggins?"
Book 2,"Do	you	have	some	sand	in	your	pussy?”	Psycho
asked."
Book 2,"“I’ll	bet	you	can’t	do	the	last	three	knots	on	one	breath.”He	said	it	with	a	smirk,	like	he	was	daring	me."
Book 2,I	knew	the	rules.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	have	to
accept	his	challenge,	but	that	would	have	made	Psycho	just	a	little	too	happy	and
I	couldn’t	allow	that."
Book 2,"I	nodded	and	kept	treading	water,	delaying	my	dive	until
my	pulse	evened	out	and	I	could	score	one	deep,	nourishing	breath."
Book 2,"Psycho
wasn’t	having	it."
Book 2,"Whenever	I	opened	my	mouth	he	splashed	water	in	my	face	to
stress	me	out	even	more,	a	tactic	used	when	trainees	started	to	panic."
Book 2,"That	made
breathing	impossible."
Book 2,"“Go	under	now	or	you	fail!”
I’d	run	out	of	time."
Book 2,"I	tried	to	gulp	some	air	before	my	duck	dive,	and	tasted	a
mouthful	of	Psycho’s	splash	water	instead	as	I	dove	to	the	bottom	of	the	pool	on
a	negative	breath	hold."
Book 2,"My	lungs	were	damn	near	empty	which	meant	I	was	in
pain	from	the	jump,	but	I	knocked	the	first	one	out	in	a	few	seconds."
Book 2,"Psycho
took	his	sweet	time	examining	my	work."
Book 2,"My	heart	was	thrumming	like	high	alert
Morse	code."
Book 2,"I	felt	it	flip	flop	in	my	chest,	like	it	was	trying	to	break	through	my
rib	cage	and	fly	to	freedom."
Book 2,"Psycho	stared	at	the	twine,	flipped	it	over	and
perused	it	with	his	eyes	and	fingers,	before	offering	a	thumb’s	up	in	slow
motion."
Book 2,"I	shook	my	head,	untied	the	rope	and	hit	the	next	one."
Book 2,"Again	he	gave	it	a
close	inspection	while	my	chest	burned	and	diaphragm	contracted,	trying	to
force	air	into	my	empty	lungs."
Book 2,The	pain	level	in	my	knee	was	at	a	ten.
Book 2,"Stars
gathered	in	my	peripheral	vision."
Book 2,"Those	multiple	stressors	had	me	teetering	like
a	Jenga	tower,	and	I	felt	like	I	was	about	to	black	out."
Book 2,"If	that	happened,	I’d	have
to	depend	on	Psycho	to	swim	me	to	the	surface	and	bring	me	around."
Book 2,"Did	I
really	trust	this	man	to	do	that?"
Book 2,He	hated	me.
Book 2,What	if	he	failed	to	execute?
Book 2,"What
if	my	body	was	too	burned-out	that	even	a	rescue	breath	couldn’t	rouse	me?"
Book 2,My	mind	was	spun	with	those	simple	toxic	questions	that	never	go	away.
Book 2,"Why
was	I	here?"
Book 2,Why	suffer	when	I	could	quit	and	be	comfortable	again?
Book 2,"Why	risk
passing	out	or	even	death	for	a	fucking	knot	drill?"
Book 2,"I	knew	that	if	I	succumbed
and	bolted	to	the	surface	my	SEAL	career	would	have	ended	then	and	there,	but
in	that	moment	I	couldn’t	figure	out	why	I	ever	gave	a	fuck."
Book 2,I	looked	over	at	Psycho.
Book 2,"He	held	both	thumbs	up	and	sported	a	big	goofy	smile
on	his	face	like	he	was	watching	a	damn	comedy	show."
Book 2,"His	split	second	of
pleasure	in	my	pain,	reminded	me	of	all	the	bullying	and	taunts	I	felt	as	a
teenager,	but	instead	of	playing	the	victim	and	letting	negative	emotions	sap	my
energy	and	force	me	to	the	surface,	a	failure,	it	was	as	if	a	new	light	blazed	inmy	brain	that	allowed	me	to	flip	the	script."
Book 2,"Time	stood	still	as	I	realized	for	the	first	time	that	I’d	always	looked	at	my	entire
life,	everything	I’d	been	through,	from	the	wrong	perspective."
Book 2,"Yes,	all	the	abuse
I’d	experienced	and	the	negativity	I	had	to	push	through	challenged	me	to	the
core,	but	in	that	moment	I	stopped	seeing	myself	as	the	victim	of	bad
circumstance,	and	saw	my	life	as	the	ultimate	training	ground	instead."
Book 2,"My
disadvantages	had	been	callousing	my	mind	all	along	and	had	prepared	me	for
that	moment	in	that	pool	with	Psycho	Pete."
Book 2,I	remember	my	very	first	day	in	the	gym	back	in	Indiana.
Book 2,"My	palms	were	soft
and	quickly	got	torn	up	on	the	bars	because	they	weren’t	accustomed	to	gripping
steel."
Book 2,"But	over	time,	after	thousands	of	reps,	my	palms	built	up	a	thick	callous	as
protection."
Book 2,The	same	principle	works	when	it	comes	to	mindset.
Book 2,"Until	you
experience	hardships	like	abuse	and	bullying,	failures	and	disappointments,	your
mind	will	remain	soft	and	exposed."
Book 2,"Life	experience,	especially	negative
experiences,	help	callous	the	mind."
Book 2,But	it’s	up	to	you	where	that	callous	lines	up.
Book 2,"If	you	choose	to	see	yourself	as	a	victim	of	circumstance	into	adulthood,	that
callous	will	become	resentment	that	protects	you	from	the	unfamiliar."
Book 2,"It	will
make	you	too	cautious	and	untrusting,	and	possibly	too	angry	at	the	world."
Book 2,"It
will	make	you	fearful	of	change	and	hard	to	reach,	but	not	hard	of	mind."
Book 2,"That’s
where	I	was	as	a	teenager,	but	after	my	second	Hell	Week,	I’d	become	someone
new."
Book 2,"I’d	fought	through	so	many	horrible	situations	by	then	and	remained	open
and	ready	for	more."
Book 2,"My	ability	to	stay	open	represented	a	willingness	to	fight	for
my	own	life,	which	allowed	me	to	withstand	hail	storms	of	pain	and	use	it	to
callous	over	my	victim’s	mentality."
Book 2,"That	shit	was	gone,	buried	under	layers	of
sweat	and	hard	fucking	flesh,	and	I	was	starting	to	callous	over	my	fears	too."
Book 2,"That	realization	gave	me	the	mental	edge	I	needed	to	outlast	Psycho	Pete	one
more	time."
Book 2,"To	show	him	he	couldn’t	hurt	me	anymore	I	smiled	back,	and	the	feeling	of
being	on	the	edge	of	a	blackout	went	away."
Book 2,"Suddenly,	I	was	energized."
Book 2,"The	pain
faded	and	I	felt	like	I	could	stay	under	all	day."
Book 2,Psycho	saw	that	in	my	eyes.
Book 2,"I	tied
off	the	last	knot	at	leisurely	pace,	glaring	at	him	the	whole	time."
Book 2,"He	gestured
with	his	hands	for	me	to	hurry	up	as	his	diaphragm	contracted."
Book 2,"I	finally	finished,
he	gave	me	a	quick	affirmative	and	kicked	to	the	surface,	desperate	for	a	breath."
Book 2,"I	took	my	time,	joined	him	topside	and	found	him	gasping,	while	I	felt	strangely
relaxed."
Book 2,"When	the	chips	were	down	at	the	pool	during	Air	Force	pararescuetraining,	I’d	buckled."
Book 2,This	time	I	won	a	major	battle	in	the	water.
Book 2,"It	was	a	big
victory,	but	the	war	wasn’t	over."
Book 2,"After	I	passed	the	knot-tying	evolution,	we	had	two	minutes	to	climb	out	on	to
the	deck,	get	dressed,	and	head	back	to	the	classroom."
Book 2,"During	First	Phase,	that’s
usually	plenty	of	time,	but	a	lot	of	us—not	just	me—were	still	healing	from	Hell
Week	and	not	moving	at	our	typical	lightning	pace."
Book 2,"On	top	of	that,	once	we	got
through	Hell	Week,	Class	231	went	through	a	bit	of	an	attitude	adjustment."
Book 2,"Hell	Week	is	designed	to	show	you	that	a	human	is	capable	of	much	more	than
you	know."
Book 2,"It	opens	your	mind	to	the	true	possibilities	of	human	potential,	and
with	that	comes	a	change	in	your	mentality."
Book 2,"You	no	longer	fear	cold	water	or
doing	push-ups	all	day."
Book 2,"You	realize	that	no	matter	what	they	do	to	you,	they	will
never	break	you,	so	you	don’t	rush	as	much	to	make	their	arbitrary	deadlines."
Book 2,"You	know	if	you	don’t	make	it,	the	instructors	will	beat	you	down."
Book 2,"Meaning
push-ups,	getting	wet	and	sandy,	anything	to	up	the	pain	and	discomfort
quotient,	but	for	those	of	us	knuckle	draggers	still	in	the	mix,	our	attitude	was,
So	the	fuck	be	it!	None	of	us	feared	the	instructors	anymore,	and	we	weren’t
about	to	rush."
Book 2,They	didn’t	like	that	one	damn	bit.
Book 2,"I	had	seen	a	lot	of	beat	downs	while	at	BUD/S,	but	the	one	we	received	that	day
will	go	down	as	one	of	the	worst	in	history."
Book 2,"We	did	push-ups	until	we	couldn’t
pick	ourselves	up	off	the	deck,	then	they	turned	us	on	our	backs	and	demanded
flutter	kicks."
Book 2,Each	kick	was	torture	for	me.
Book 2,"I	kept	putting	my	legs	down	because
of	the	pain."
Book 2,"I	was	showing	weakness	and	if	you	show	weakness,	IT	IS	ON!
Psycho	and	SBG	descended	and	took	turns	on	me."
Book 2,"I	went	from	push-ups	to
flutter	kicks	to	bear	crawls	until	they	got	tired."
Book 2,"I	could	feel	the	moving	parts	of
my	knee	shifting,	floating,	and	grabbing	every	time	I	bent	it	to	do	those	bear
crawls,	and	it	was	agonizing."
Book 2,"I	moved	slower	than	normal	and	knew	I	was
broken."
Book 2,That	simple	question	bubbled	up	again.
Book 2,Why?
Book 2,"What	was	I	trying	to
prove?"
Book 2,Quitting	seemed	the	sane	choice.
Book 2,"The	comfort	of	mediocrity	sounded	like
sweet	relief	until	Psycho	screamed	in	my	ear."
Book 2,"“Move	faster,	motherfucker!”
Once	again,	an	amazing	feeling	washed	over	me."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	focused	on	outdoing
him	this	time."
Book 2,"I	was	in	the	worst	pain	of	my	life,	but	my	victory	in	the	poolminutes	before	came	rushing	back."
Book 2,"I’d	finally	proved	to	myself	that	I	was	a
decent	enough	waterman	to	belong	in	the	Navy	SEALs.	Heady	stuff	for	a
negatively	buoyant	kid	that	never	took	a	swim	lesson	in	his	entire	life."
Book 2,"And	the
reason	I	got	there	was	because	I’d	put	in	the	work."
Book 2,"The	pool	had	been	my
kryptonite."
Book 2,"Even	though	I	was	a	far	better	swimmer	as	a	SEAL	candidate,	I	was
still	so	stressed	about	water	evolutions	that	I	used	to	hit	the	pool	after	a	day	of
training	at	least	three	times	a	week."
Book 2,"I	scaled	the	fifteen-foot	fence	just	to	gain
after-hours	access."
Book 2,"Other	than	the	academic	aspect,	nothing	scared	me	as	much
about	the	prospects	of	BUD/S	like	the	swimming	drills,	and	by	dedicating	time	I
was	able	to	callous	over	that	fear	and	hit	new	levels	underwater	when	the
pressure	was	on."
Book 2,"I	thought	about	the	incredible	power	of	a	calloused	mind	on	task,	as	Psycho	and
SBG	beat	me	down,	and	that	thought	became	a	feeling	that	took	over	my	body
and	made	me	move	as	fast	as	a	bear	around	that	pool."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	believe	what	I
was	doing."
Book 2,"The	intense	pain	was	gone,	and	so	were	those	nagging	questions."
Book 2,"I
was	putting	out	harder	than	ever,	breaking	through	the	limitations	of	injury	and
pain	tolerance,	and	riding	a	second	wind	delivered	by	a	calloused	mind."
Book 2,"After	the	bear	crawls,	I	went	back	to	doing	flutter	kicks,	and	I	still	had	no	pain!
As	we	were	leaving	the	pool	a	half-hour	later,	SBG	asked,	“Goggins,	what	got
into	your	ass	to	make	you	Superman?”	I	just	smiled	and	left	the	pool."
Book 2,"I	didn’t
want	to	say	anything	because	I	didn’t	yet	understand	what	I	now	know."
Book 2,"Similar	to	using	an	opponent’s	energy	to	gain	an	advantage,	leaning	on	your
calloused	mind	in	the	heat	of	battle	can	shift	your	thinking	as	well."
Book 2,"Remembering	what	you’ve	been	through	and	how	that	has	strengthened	your
mindset	can	lift	you	out	of	a	negative	brain	loop	and	help	you	bypass	those
weak,	one-second	impulses	to	give	in	so	you	can	power	through	obstacles."
Book 2,"And
when	you	leverage	a	calloused	mind	like	I	did	around	the	pool	that	day	and	keep
fighting	through	pain,	it	can	help	you	push	your	limits	because	if	you	accept	the
pain	as	a	natural	process	and	refuse	to	give	in	and	give	up,	you	will	engage	the
sympathetic	nervous	system	which	shifts	your	hormonal	flow."
Book 2,The	sympathetic	nervous	system	is	your	fight	or	flight	reflex.
Book 2,"It’s	bubbling	just
below	the	surface,	and	when	you	are	lost,	stressed	out,	or	struggling,	like	I	was
when	I	was	a	down	and	out	kid,	that’s	the	part	of	your	mind	that’s	driving	the
bus."
Book 2,We’ve	all	tasted	this	feeling	before.
Book 2,"Those	mornings	when	going	on	a	run	isthe	last	thing	you	want	to	do,	but	then	twenty	minutes	into	it	you	feel	energized,
that’s	the	work	of	the	sympathetic	nervous	system."
Book 2,"What	I’ve	found	is	that	you
can	tap	into	it	on-call	as	long	as	you	know	how	to	manage	your	own	mind."
Book 2,"When	you	indulge	in	negative	self-talk,	the	gifts	of	a	sympathetic	response	will
remain	out	of	reach."
Book 2,"However,	if	you	can	manage	those	moments	of	pain	that
come	with	maximum	effort,	by	remembering	what	you’ve	been	through	to	get	to
that	point	in	your	life,	you	will	be	in	a	better	position	to	persevere	and	choose
fight	over	flight."
Book 2,"That	will	allow	you	to	use	the	adrenaline	that	comes	with	a
sympathetic	response	to	go	even	harder."
Book 2,Obstacles	at	work	and	school	can	also	be	overcome	with	your	calloused	mind.
Book 2,"In
those	cases,	pushing	through	a	given	flashpoint	isn’t	likely	to	lead	to	a
sympathetic	response,	but	it	will	keep	you	motivated	to	push	through	any	doubt
you	feel	about	your	own	abilities."
Book 2,"No	matter	the	task	at	hand,	there	is	always
opportunity	for	self-doubt."
Book 2,"Whenever	you	decide	to	follow	a	dream	or	set	a	goal,
you	are	just	as	likely	to	come	up	with	all	the	reasons	why	the	likelihood	of
success	is	low."
Book 2,"Blame	it	on	the	fucked-up	evolutionary	wiring	of	the	human
mind."
Book 2,"But	you	don’t	have	to	let	your	doubt	into	the	cockpit!	You	can	tolerate
doubt	as	a	backseat	driver,	but	if	you	put	doubt	in	the	pilot’s	seat,	defeat	is
guaranteed."
Book 2,"Remembering	that	you’ve	been	through	difficulties	before	and	have
always	survived	to	fight	again	shifts	the	conversation	in	your	head."
Book 2,"It	will	allow
you	to	control	and	manage	doubt,	and	keep	you	focused	on	taking	each	and
every	step	necessary	to	achieve	the	task	at	hand."
Book 2,"Sounds	simple,	right?"
Book 2,It	isn’t.
Book 2,"Very	few	people	even	bother	to	try	to	control	the
way	their	thoughts	and	doubts	bubble	up."
Book 2,"The	vast	majority	of	us	are	slaves	to
our	minds."
Book 2,"Most	don’t	even	make	the	first	effort	when	it	comes	to	mastering
their	thought	process	because	it’s	a	never-ending	chore	and	impossible	to	get
right	every	time."
Book 2,"The	average	person	thinks	2,000–3,000	thoughts	per	hour."
Book 2,That’s	thirty	to	fifty	per	minute!	Some	of	those	shots	will	slip	by	the	goalie.
Book 2,"It’s
inevitable."
Book 2,Especially	if	you	coast	through	life.
Book 2,"Physical	training	is	the	perfect	crucible	to	learn	how	to	manage	your	thought
process	because	when	you’re	working	out,	your	focus	is	more	likely	to	be	single
pointed,	and	your	response	to	stress	and	pain	is	immediate	and	measurable."
Book 2,"Do
you	hammer	hard	and	snag	that	personal	best	like	you	said	you	would,	or	do	you
crumble?"
Book 2,"That	decision	rarely	comes	down	to	physical	ability,	it’s	almost	alwaysa	test	of	how	well	you	are	managing	your	own	mind."
Book 2,"If	you	push	yourself
through	each	split	and	use	that	energy	to	maintain	a	strong	pace,	you	have	a
great	chance	of	recording	a	faster	time."
Book 2,"Granted,	some	days	it’s	easier	to	do	that
than	others."
Book 2,"And	the	clock,	or	the	score,	doesn’t	matter	anyway."
Book 2,"The	reason	it’s
important	to	push	hardest	when	you	want	to	quit	the	most	is	because	it	helps	you
callous	your	mind."
Book 2,"It’s	the	same	reason	why	you	have	to	do	your	best	work	when
you	are	the	least	motivated."
Book 2,"That’s	why	I	loved	PT	in	BUD/S	and	why	I	still	love
it	today."
Book 2,"Physical	challenges	strengthen	my	mind	so	I’m	ready	for	whatever	life
throws	at	me,	and	it	will	do	the	same	for	you."
Book 2,"But	no	matter	how	well	you	deploy	it,	a	calloused	mind	can’t	heal	broken	bones."
Book 2,"On	the	mile-long	hike	back	to	the	BUD/S	compound,	the	feeling	of	victory
evaporated,	and	I	could	feel	the	damage	I’d	done."
Book 2,"I	had	twenty	weeks	of	training
in	front	of	me,	dozens	of	evolutions	ahead,	and	I	could	barely	walk."
Book 2,"While	I
wanted	to	deny	the	pain	in	my	knee,	I	knew	I	was	fucked	so	I	limped	straight	to
medical."
Book 2,"When	he	saw	my	knee,	the	doc	didn’t	say	a	damn	thing."
Book 2,"He	just	shook	his	head
and	sent	me	to	get	an	x-ray	that	revealed	a	fractured	kneecap."
Book 2,"In	BUD/S	when
reservists	sustain	injuries	that	take	a	long	time	to	heal,	they’re	sent	home,	and
that’s	what	happened	to	me."
Book 2,"I	crutched	my	ass	back	to	the	barracks,	demoralized,	and	while	checking	out,	I
saw	some	of	the	guys	that	quit	during	Hell	Week."
Book 2,"When	I	first	glimpsed	their
helmets	lined	up	beneath	the	bell,	I	felt	sorry	for	them	because	I	knew	the	empty
feeling	of	giving	up,	but	seeing	them	face	to	face	reminded	me	that	failure	is	a
part	of	life	and	now	we	all	had	to	press	on."
Book 2,"I	hadn’t	quit,	so	I	knew	I’d	be	invited	back,	but	I	had	no	idea	if	that	meant	a	third
Hell	Week	or	not."
Book 2,"Or	if	after	getting	rolled	twice	I	still	had	the	burning	desire	to
fight	through	another	hurricane	of	pain	with	no	guarantee	of	success."
Book 2,"Given	my
injury	record,	how	could	I?"
Book 2,"I	left	the	BUD/S	compound	with	more	self
awareness	and	more	mastery	over	my	mind	than	I’d	ever	had	before,	but	my
future	was	just	as	uncertain."
Book 2,"***
Airplanes	have	always	made	me	claustrophobic,	so	I	decided	to	take	the	trainfrom	San	Diego	to	Chicago,	which	gave	me	three	full	days	to	think,	and	my
mind	was	all	fucked	up."
Book 2,"On	the	first	day	I	didn’t	know	if	I	wanted	to	be	a	SEAL
anymore."
Book 2,I	had	overcome	a	lot.
Book 2,"I	beat	Hell	Week,	realized	the	power	of	a
calloused	mind	and	conquered	my	fear	of	the	water."
Book 2,"Perhaps	I’d	already	learned
enough	about	myself?"
Book 2,What	else	did	I	need	to	prove?
Book 2,"On	day	two	I	thought
about	all	the	other	jobs	I	could	sign	up	for."
Book 2,"Maybe	I	should	move	on	and	become
a	firefighter?"
Book 2,"That’s	a	bad-ass	job,	and	it	would	be	an	opportunity	to	become	a
different	sort	of	hero."
Book 2,"But	on	day	three,	as	the	train	veered	into	Chicago,	I
slipped	into	a	bathroom	the	size	of	a	phone	booth	and	checked	in	with	the
Accountability	Mirror."
Book 2,Is	that	really	how	you	feel?
Book 2,"Are	you	sure	you’re	ready	to
give	up	on	the	SEALs	and	become	a	civilian	fireman?"
Book 2,"I	stared	at	myself	for	five
minutes	before	I	shook	my	head."
Book 2,I	couldn’t	lie.
Book 2,"I	had	to	tell	myself	the	truth,	out
loud."
Book 2,“I’m	afraid.
Book 2,I’m	afraid	of	going	through	all	of	that	shit	again.
Book 2,"I’m	afraid	of	day
one,	week	one.”
I	was	divorced	by	then,	but	my	ex-wife,	Pam,	met	me	at	the	train	station	to	drive
me	home	to	my	mother’s	place	in	Indianapolis."
Book 2,Pam	was	still	living	in	Brazil.
Book 2,"We’d	been	in	touch	while	I	was	in	San	Diego,	and	after	seeing	each	other
through	the	crowd	on	the	train	platform,	we	fell	back	on	our	habits,	and	later	that
night	we	fell	into	bed."
Book 2,"That	whole	summer,	from	May	to	November,	I	stayed	in	the	Midwest,	healing
up	then	rehabbing	my	knee."
Book 2,"I	was	still	a	reservist	but	remained	undecided	about
going	back	to	Navy	SEAL	training."
Book 2,I	looked	into	the	Marine	Corps.
Book 2,"I	explored
the	application	process	for	a	handful	of	fire	fighting	units	but	finally	picked	up
the	phone,	ready	to	call	into	the	BUD/S	compound."
Book 2,"They	needed	my	final
answer."
Book 2,"I	sat	there,	holding	the	telephone,	and	thought	about	the	misery	of	SEAL
training."
Book 2,"Shit,	you	run	six	miles	a	day	just	to	eat,	not	including	your	training
runs."
Book 2,"I	visualized	all	the	swimming	and	paddling,	carrying	heavy-ass	boats	and
logs	on	our	heads,	over	the	berm	all	day."
Book 2,"I	flashed	onto	hours	of	sit-ups,	push-
ups,	flutter	kicks,	and	the	O-Course."
Book 2,"I	remembered	the	feeling	of	rolling	around
in	the	sand,	of	being	chafed	all	fucking	day	and	night."
Book 2,"My	memories	were	a
mind-body	experience,	and	I	felt	the	cold	deep	in	my	bones."
Book 2,"A	normal	person
would	give	up."
Book 2,"They’d	say,	fuck	it,	it’s	just	not	meant	to	be,	and	refuse	to	torturethemselves	one	minute	more."
Book 2,But	I	wasn’t	wired	normal.
Book 2,"As	I	dialed	the	number,	negativity	rose	up	like	an	angry	shadow."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	help
but	think	that	I	was	put	on	this	earth	to	suffer."
Book 2,"Why	wouldn’t	my	own	personal
demons,	the	fates,	God,	or	Satan,	just	leave	me	the	fuck	alone?"
Book 2,"I	was	tired	of
trying	to	prove	myself."
Book 2,Tired	of	callousing	my	mind.
Book 2,"Mentally,	I	was	worn	to	the
nub."
Book 2,"At	the	same	time,	being	worn	the	fuck	down	is	the	price	of	being	hard	and	I
knew	if	I	quit,	those	feelings	and	thoughts	wouldn’t	just	go	away."
Book 2,"The	cost	of
quitting	would	be	lifelong	purgatory."
Book 2,"I’d	be	trapped	in	the	knowing	that	I	didn’t
stay	in	the	fight	to	the	bitter	end."
Book 2,There	is	no	shame	in	getting	knocked	out.
Book 2,"The
shame	comes	when	you	throw	in	the	motherfucking	towel,	and	if	I	was	born	to
suffer,	then	I	may	as	well	take	my	medicine."
Book 2,"The	training	officer	welcomed	me	back	and	confirmed	that	I	was	starting	from
day	one,	week	one."
Book 2,"As	expected,	my	brown	shirt	would	have	to	be	swapped	out
for	a	white	one,	and	he	had	one	more	sliver	of	sunshine	to	share."
Book 2,"“Just	so	you
know,	Goggins,”	he	said,	“this	will	be	the	last	time	we	will	allow	you	to	go
through	BUD/S	training."
Book 2,"If	you	get	injured,	that’s	it."
Book 2,"We	will	not	allow	you	to
come	back	again.”
“Roger	that,”	I	said."
Book 2,Class	235	would	muster	in	just	four	weeks.
Book 2,"My	knee	still	wasn’t	all	the	way
right,	but	I’d	better	be	ready	because	the	ultimate	test	was	about	to	begin."
Book 2,"Within	seconds	of	hanging	up	the	phone,	Pam	called	and	said	she	needed	to	see
me."
Book 2,It	was	good	timing.
Book 2,"I	was	leaving	town	again,	hopefully	for	good	this	time,
and	I	needed	to	level	with	her."
Book 2,"We’d	been	enjoying	one	another,	but	it	was
always	a	temporary	thing	for	me."
Book 2,"We’d	been	married	once	and	we	were	still
different	people	with	totally	different	worldviews."
Book 2,"That	hadn’t	changed	and
obviously	neither	had	some	of	my	insecurities,	as	they	kept	me	going	back	to
what	was	familiar."
Book 2,"Insanity	is	doing	the	same	thing	over	and	over	again	and
expecting	a	different	result."
Book 2,We	would	never	work	and	it	was	time	to	say	so.
Book 2,"She	got	to	her	news	first.“I’m	late,”	she	said,	as	she	burst	through	the	door,	clutching	a	brown	paper	bag."
Book 2,"“Like	late	late.”	She	seemed	excited	and	nervous	as	she	disappeared	into	the
bathroom."
Book 2,"I	could	hear	that	bag	crinkle	and	the	tearing	open	of	a	package	as	I	lay
on	my	bed	staring	at	the	ceiling."
Book 2,"Minutes	later,	she	opened	the	bathroom	door,	a
pregnancy	test	in	her	fist	and	a	big	smile	on	her	face."
Book 2,"“I	knew	it,”	she	said,	biting
her	lower	lip."
Book 2,"“Look,	David,	we’re	pregnant!”
I	stood	up	slow,	she	hugged	me	with	everything	she	had,	and	her	excitement
broke	my	heart."
Book 2,It	wasn’t	supposed	to	go	like	this.
Book 2,I	wasn’t	ready.
Book 2,"My	body	was
still	broken,	I	was	$30,000	in	credit	card	debt,	and	still	only	a	reservist."
Book 2,"I	had	no
address	of	my	own	and	no	car."
Book 2,"I	was	unstable,	and	that	made	me	very	insecure."
Book 2,"Plus,	I	wasn’t	even	in	love	with	this	woman."
Book 2,"That’s	what	I	said	to	myself	while	I
stared	into	that	Accountability	Mirror	over	her	shoulder."
Book 2,"The	mirror	that	never
lies."
Book 2,I	averted	my	eyes.
Book 2,Pam	went	home	to	share	the	news	with	her	parents.
Book 2,"I	walked	her	to	the	door	of
my	mother’s	place,	then	slumped	into	the	couch."
Book 2,"In	Coronado,	I	felt	like	I’d
come	to	terms	with	my	fucked	up	past	and	found	some	power	there,	and	here	I
was	sucked	under	once	again."
Book 2,"Now	it	wasn’t	just	about	me	and	my	dreams	of
becoming	a	SEAL."
Book 2,"I	had	a	family	to	think	about,	which	raised	the	stakes	that
much	higher."
Book 2,"If	I	failed	this	time,	it	wouldn’t	mean	that	I	was	just	going	back	to
ground	zero,	emotionally	and	financially,	but	I	would	be	bringing	my	new
family	there	with	me."
Book 2,"When	my	mother	got	home	I	told	her	everything,	and	as
we	talked	the	dam	broke	and	my	fear,	sadness,	and	struggle	came	bursting	out	of
me."
Book 2,I	put	my	head	in	my	hands	and	sobbed.
Book 2,"“Mom,	my	life	from	the	time	I	was	born	until	now	has	been	a	nightmare."
Book 2,"A
nightmare	that	keeps	getting	worse,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“The	harder	I	try,	the	harder	my	life
becomes.”
“I	can’t	argue	with	that,	David,”	she	said."
Book 2,"My	mom	knew	hell	and	she	wasn’t
trying	to	baby	me."
Book 2,She	never	had.
Book 2,"“But	I	also	know	you	well	enough	to	know
that	you	will	find	a	way	to	get	through	this.”
“I	have	to,”	I	said	as	I	wiped	the	tears	from	my	eyes."
Book 2,"“I	don’t	have	a	choice.”She	left	me	alone,	and	I	sat	on	that	couch	all	night."
Book 2,"I	felt	like	I’d	been	stripped	of
everything,	but	I	was	still	breathing,	which	meant	I	had	to	find	a	way	to	keep
going."
Book 2,"I	had	to	compartmentalize	doubt	and	find	the	strength	to	believe	that	I
was	born	to	be	more	than	some	tired-ass	Navy	SEAL	reject."
Book 2,"After	Hell	Week	I’d
felt	I	had	become	unbreakable,	yet	within	a	week	I’d	been	zeroed	out."
Book 2,"I	hadn’t
levelled	up	after	all."
Book 2,"I	still	wasn’t	shit,	and	if	I	was	going	to	fix	my	broke-down
life,	I	would	have	to	become	more!
On	that	sofa,	I	found	a	way."
Book 2,"By	then	I’d	learned	how	to	hold	myself	accountable,	and	I	knew	I	could	take	a
man’s	soul	in	the	heat	of	battle."
Book 2,"I	had	overcome	many	obstacles,	and	realized
that	each	of	those	experiences	had	calloused	my	mind	so	thick,	I	could	take	on
any	challenge."
Book 2,"All	of	that	that	made	me	feel	like	I’d	dealt	with	my	past	demons,
but	I	hadn’t."
Book 2,I’d	been	ignoring	them.
Book 2,"My	memories	of	abuse	at	the	hands	of	my
father,	of	all	those	people	who	called	me	nigger,	didn’t	vaporize	after	a	few
victories."
Book 2,"Those	moments	were	anchored	deep	in	my	subconscious,	and	as	a
result,	my	foundation	was	cracked."
Book 2,"In	a	human	being	your	character	is	your
foundation,	and	when	you	build	a	bunch	of	successes	and	pile	up	even	more
failures	on	a	fucked-up	foundation,	the	structure	that	is	the	self	won’t	be	sound."
Book 2,"To	develop	an	armored	mind—a	mindset	so	calloused	and	hard	that	it	becomes
bulletproof—you	need	to	go	to	the	source	of	all	your	fears	and	insecurities."
Book 2,"Most	of	us	sweep	our	failures	and	evil	secrets	under	the	rug,	but	when	we	run
into	problems,	that	rug	gets	lifted	up,	and	our	darkness	re-emerges,	floods	our
soul,	and	influences	the	decisions	which	determine	our	character."
Book 2,"My	fears	were
never	just	about	the	water,	and	my	anxieties	toward	Class	235	weren’t	about	the
pain	of	First	Phase."
Book 2,"They	were	seeping	from	the	infected	wounds	I’d	been
walking	around	with	my	entire	life,	and	my	denial	of	them	amounted	to	a	denial
of	myself."
Book 2,"I	was	my	own	worst	enemy!	It	wasn’t	the	world,	or	God,	or	the	Devil
that	was	out	to	get	me."
Book 2,"It	was	me!
I	was	rejecting	my	past	and	therefore	rejecting	myself."
Book 2,"My	foundation,	my
character	was	defined	by	self-rejection."
Book 2,"All	my	fears	came	from	that	deep-seated
uneasiness	I	carried	with	being	David	Goggins	because	of	what	I’d	gone
through."
Book 2,"Even	after	I’d	reached	a	point	where	I	no	longer	cared	about	what
others	thought	of	me,	I	still	had	trouble	accepting	me.Anyone	who	is	of	sound	mind	and	body	can	sit	down	and	think	of	twenty	things
in	their	life	that	could	have	gone	differently."
Book 2,"Where	maybe	they	didn’t	get	a	fair
shake	and	where	they	took	the	path	of	least	resistance."
Book 2,"If	you’re	one	of	the	few
who	acknowledge	that,	want	to	callous	those	wounds,	and	strengthen	your
character,	its	up	to	you	to	go	back	through	your	past	and	make	peace	with
yourself	by	facing	those	incidents	and	all	of	your	negative	influences,	and
accepting	them	as	weak	spots	in	your	own	character."
Book 2,"Only	when	you	identify
and	accept	your	weaknesses	will	you	finally	stop	running	from	your	past."
Book 2,"Then
those	incidents	can	be	used	more	efficiently	as	fuel	to	become	better	and	grow
stronger."
Book 2,"Right	there	on	mom’s	couch,	as	the	moon	burned	its	arc	in	the	night	sky,	I	faced
down	my	demons."
Book 2,I	faced	myself.
Book 2,I	couldn’t	run	from	my	dad	anymore.
Book 2,"I	had	to
accept	that	he	was	part	of	me	and	that	his	lying,	cheating	character	influenced
me	more	than	I	cared	to	admit."
Book 2,"Before	that	night,	I	used	to	tell	people	that	my
father	had	died	rather	than	tell	the	truth	about	where	I	came	from."
Book 2,"Even	in	the
SEALs	I	trotted	out	that	lie."
Book 2,I	knew	why.
Book 2,"When	you	get	beat	up,	you	don’t	want
to	acknowledge	getting	your	ass	kicked."
Book 2,"It	doesn’t	make	you	feel	very	manly,	so
the	easiest	thing	to	do	is	forget	about	it	and	move	on."
Book 2,Pretend	it	never	happened.
Book 2,Not	anymore.
Book 2,"Going	forward	it	became	very	important	for	me	to	rehash	my	life,	because	when
you	examine	your	experiences	with	a	fine-toothed	comb	and	see	where	your
issues	come	from,	you	can	find	strength	in	enduring	pain	and	abuse."
Book 2,"By
accepting	Trunnis	Goggins	as	part	of	me,	I	was	free	to	use	where	I	came	from	as
fuel."
Book 2,"I	realized	that	each	episode	of	child	abuse	that	could	have	killed	me	made
me	tough	as	hell	and	as	sharp	as	a	Samurai’s	blade."
Book 2,"True,	I	had	been	dealt	a	fucked-up	hand,	but	that	night	I	started	thinking	of	it	as
running	a	100-mile	race	with	a	fifty-pound	ruck	on	my	back."
Book 2,"Could	I	still
compete	in	that	race	even	if	everyone	else	was	running	free	and	easy,	weighing
130	pounds?"
Book 2,How	fast	would	I	be	able	to	run	once	I’d	shed	that	dead	weight?
Book 2,"I
wasn’t	even	thinking	about	ultras	yet."
Book 2,"To	me	the	race	was	life	itself,	and	the
more	I	took	inventory,	the	more	I	realized	how	prepared	I	was	for	the	fucked-up
events	yet	to	come."
Book 2,"Life	had	put	me	in	the	fire,	taken	me	out,	and	hammered	me
repeatedly,	and	diving	back	into	the	BUD/S	cauldron,	feeling	a	third	Hell	Week
in	a	calendar	year,	would	decorate	me	with	a	PhD	in	pain."
Book 2,"I	was	about	to	becomethe	sharpest	sword	ever	made!
***
I	showed	up	to	Class	235	on	a	mission	and	kept	to	myself	throughout	much	of
First	Phase."
Book 2,There	were	156	men	in	that	class	on	day	one.
Book 2,"I	still	led	from	the
front,	but	I	wasn’t	about	shepherding	anyone	through	Hell	Week	this	time."
Book 2,"My
knee	was	still	sore	and	I	needed	to	put	every	ounce	of	energy	into	getting	my	ass
through	BUD/S."
Book 2,"I	had	everything	riding	on	the	next	six	months,	and	I	had	no
illusions	about	how	difficult	it	would	be	to	make	it	through."
Book 2,Case	in	point:	Shawn	Dobbs.
Book 2,"Dobbs	grew	up	poor	in	Jacksonville,	Florida."
Book 2,"He	battled	some	of	the	same
demons	I	did,	and	he	came	into	class	with	a	chip	on	his	shoulder."
Book 2,"Right	away,	I
could	see	he	was	an	elite,	natural	athlete."
Book 2,"He	was	at	or	near	the	front	on	all	the
runs,	he	blitzed	the	O-Course	in	8:30	after	just	a	few	reps,	and	he	knew	he	was	a
bad	motherfucker."
Book 2,"Then	again,	like	the	Taoists	say,	those	that	know	don’t	speak,
and	those	who	speak,	well,	they	don’t	know	jack	shit."
Book 2,"On	the	night	before	Hell	Week	began	he	talked	a	lot	of	noise	about	the	guys	in
Class	235."
Book 2,"There	were	already	fifty-five	helmets	on	the	Grinder,	and	he	was	sure
he’d	be	one	of	a	handful	of	graduates	at	the	end."
Book 2,"He	mentioned	the	guys	he	knew
would	make	it	through	Hell	Week	and	also	talked	a	lot	of	nonsense	about	the
guys	he	knew	would	quit."
Book 2,"He	had	no	clue	that	he	was	making	the	classic	mistake	of	measuring	himself
against	others	in	his	class."
Book 2,"When	he	beat	them	in	an	evolution	or	outperformed
them	during	PT,	he	took	a	lot	of	pride	in	that."
Book 2,"It	boosted	his	self-confidence	and
his	performance."
Book 2,"In	BUD/S,	it’s	common	and	natural	to	do	some	of	that."
Book 2,"It’s	all
part	of	the	competitive	nature	of	the	alpha	males	who	are	drawn	to	the	SEALs,
but	he	didn’t	realize	that	during	Hell	Week	you	need	a	solid	boat	crew	to
survive,	which	means	depending	upon	your	classmates,	not	defeating	them."
Book 2,"While	he	talked	and	talked,	I	took	notice."
Book 2,"He	had	no	idea	what	was	in	store	for
him	and	how	bad	sleep	deprivation	and	being	cold	fucks	you	up."
Book 2,"He	was	about
to	find	out."
Book 2,"In	the	early	hours	of	Hell	Week,	he	performed	well,	but	that	same
drive	to	defeat	his	classmates	in	evolutions	and	on	timed	runs	came	out	on	the
beach.At	5’4”	and	188	pounds,	Dobbs	was	built	like	a	fire	hydrant,	but	since	he	was
short	he	was	assigned	to	a	boat	crew	of	smaller	guys	referred	to	as	Smurfs	by	the
instructors."
Book 2,"In	fact,	Psycho	Pete	made	them	draw	a	picture	of	Papa	Smurf	on	the
front	of	their	boat	just	to	fuck	with	them."
Book 2,"That’s	the	kind	of	thing	our	instructors
did."
Book 2,"They	looked	for	any	way	to	break	you,	and	with	Dobbs	it	worked."
Book 2,"He	didn’t
like	being	grouped	up	with	guys	he	considered	smaller	and	weaker,	and	took	it
out	on	his	teammates."
Book 2,"Over	the	next	day	he	would	grind	his	own	crew	down
before	our	eyes."
Book 2,"He	took	up	the	position	at	the	front	of	the	boat	or	the	log	and	set
a	blistering	pace	on	the	runs."
Book 2,"Instead	of	checking	in	with	his	crew	and	holding
something	back	in	reserve,	he	went	all	out	from	the	jump."
Book 2,"I	reached	out	to	him
recently	and	he	said	he	remembered	BUD/S	like	it	happened	last	week."
Book 2,"“I	was	grinding	an	axe	on	my	own	people,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“I	was	purposely	beating
them	down,	almost	like	if	I	made	guys	quit,	it	was	a	checkmark	on	my	helmet.”
By	Monday	morning	he’d	done	a	decent	job	of	it."
Book 2,"Two	of	his	guys	had	quit	and
that	meant	four	smaller	guys	had	to	carry	their	boat	and	log	by	themselves."
Book 2,"He
admitted	he	was	fighting	his	own	demons	on	that	beach."
Book 2,"That	his	foundation	was
cracked."
Book 2,"“I	was	an	insecure	person	with	low	self	esteem	trying	to	grind	an	axe,”	he	said,
“and	my	own	ego,	arrogance,	and	insecurity	made	my	own	life	more	difficult.”
Translation:	his	mind	broke	down	in	ways	he’d	never	experienced	before	or
since."
Book 2,"On	Monday	afternoon	we	did	a	bay	swim,	and	when	he	emerged	from	the	water,
he	was	hurting."
Book 2,"Watching	him	it	was	obvious	he	could	barely	walk	and	that	his
mind	was	teetering	on	the	brink."
Book 2,"We	locked	eyes	and	I	saw	that	he	was	asking
himself	those	simple	questions	and	couldn’t	find	an	answer."
Book 2,"He	looked	a	lot	like
I	did	when	I	was	in	Pararescue,	searching	for	a	way	out."
Book 2,"From	then	on	Dobbs
was	one	of	the	worst	performers	on	the	whole	beach,	and	that	fucked	him	up
bad."
Book 2,"“All	the	people	I’d	categorized	as	lower	than	worms	were	kicking	my	butt,”	he
said."
Book 2,"Soon	his	crew	was	down	to	two	men,	and	he	got	moved	to	another	boat
crew	with	taller	guys."
Book 2,"When	they	lifted	the	boat	head	high,	he	wasn’t	even	able
to	reach	that	motherfucker,	and	all	of	his	insecurities	about	his	size	and	his	paststarted	caving	in	on	him."
Book 2,"“I	started	to	believe	that	I	didn’t	belong	there,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“That	I	was	genetically
inferior."
Book 2,"It	was	like	I	had	superpowers,	and	I’d	lost	them."
Book 2,"I	was	in	a	place	in	my
mind	I’d	never	been,	and	I	didn’t	have	a	road	map.”
Think	about	where	he	was	at	that	time."
Book 2,"This	man	had	excelled	through	the	first
few	weeks	of	BUD/S."
Book 2,He’d	come	from	nothing	and	was	a	phenomenal	athlete.
Book 2,He	had	so	many	experiences	along	the	way	he	could	have	leaned	on.
Book 2,"He’d
calloused	his	mind	plenty,	but	because	his	foundation	was	cracked,	when	shit	got
real	he	lost	control	of	his	mindset	and	became	a	slave	to	his	self	doubt."
Book 2,"On	Monday	night,	Dobbs	reported	to	medical	complaining	about	his	feet."
Book 2,"He
was	sure	he	had	stress	fractures,	but	when	he	took	off	his	boots	they	weren’t
swollen	or	black	and	blue	like	he’d	imagined."
Book 2,They	looked	perfectly	healthy.
Book 2,"I
know	that	because	I	was	at	med	check	too,	sitting	right	beside	him."
Book 2,"I	saw	his
blank	stare	and	knew	the	inevitable	was	near."
Book 2,"It	was	the	look	that	comes	over	a
man’s	face	after	he	surrenders	his	soul."
Book 2,"I	had	the	same	look	in	my	eyes	when	I
quit	Pararescue."
Book 2,"What	will	forever	bond	me	and	Shawn	Dobbs	is	the	fact	that	I
knew	he	was	going	to	quit	before	he	did."
Book 2,The	docs	offered	him	Motrin	and	sent	him	back	into	the	suffering.
Book 2,"I	remember
watching	Shawn	lace	his	boots,	wondering	at	what	point	he	would	finally	break."
Book 2,"That’s	when	SBG	pulled	up	in	his	truck	and	yelled,	“This	will	be	the	coldest
night	that	you	will	ever	experience	in	your	entire	lives!”
I	was	under	my	boat	with	my	crew	headed	toward	the	infamous	Steel	Pier	when
I	glanced	behind	me	and	saw	Shawn	in	the	back	of	SBG’s	warm	truck."
Book 2,"He’d
surrendered."
Book 2,"Within	minutes	he	would	toll	the	bell	three	times,	and	place	his
helmet	down."
Book 2,"In	Dobbs’	defense,	this	was	one	nightmare	of	a	Hell	Week."
Book 2,"It	rained	all	day	and
all	night,	which	meant	you	never	got	warm	and	never	got	dry."
Book 2,"Plus,	somebody	in
command	had	the	brilliant	idea	that	the	class	shouldn’t	be	fed	and	watered	like
kings	at	chow."
Book 2,"Instead,	we	were	supplied	cold	MREs	for	almost	every	meal."
Book 2,They	thought	that	would	test	us	even	more.
Book 2,"Make	it	more	like	a	real-world
battlefield	situation."
Book 2,"It	also	meant	there	was	absolutely	no	relief,	and	without
abundant	calories	to	burn	it	was	hard	for	anybody	to	find	the	energy	to	pushthrough	pain	and	exhaustion,	let	alone	keep	warm."
Book 2,"Yes,	it	was	miserable,	but	I	fucking	loved	it."
Book 2,"I	thrived	off	of	the	barbaric	beauty
of	seeing	the	soul	of	a	man	destroyed,	only	to	rise	again	and	overcome	every
obstacle	in	his	path."
Book 2,"By	my	third	go	’round,	I	knew	what	the	human	body	could
take."
Book 2,"I	knew	what	I	could	take,	and	I	was	feeding	off	that	shit."
Book 2,"At	the	same	time,
my	legs	didn’t	feel	right	and	my	knee	had	been	barking	since	day	one."
Book 2,"So	far,	the
pain	was	something	I	could	handle	for	at	least	a	couple	more	days,	but	the
thought	of	injury	was	a	whole	different	piece	of	fuck-you	pie	that	I	had	to	block
out	of	my	mind."
Book 2,"I	went	into	a	dark	place	where	there	was	just	me	and	the	pain
and	suffering."
Book 2,I	didn’t	focus	on	my	classmates	or	my	instructors.
Book 2,"I	went	full
caveman."
Book 2,I	was	willing	to	die	to	make	it	through	that	motherfucker.
Book 2,I	wasn’t	the	only	one.
Book 2,"Late	on	Wednesday	night,	with	thirty-six	hours	to	go
before	the	end	of	Hell	Week,	tragedy	hit	Class	235."
Book 2,"We	were	in	the	pool	for	an
evolution	called	the	caterpillar	swim,	in	which	each	boat	crew	swam	on	their
backs,	legs	locked	around	torsos,	in	a	chain."
Book 2,"We	had	to	use	our	hands	in	concert
to	swim."
Book 2,We	mustered	up	at	the	pool.
Book 2,"There	were	just	twenty-six	guys	left	and	one	of
them	was	named	John	Skop."
Book 2,"Mr.	Skop	was	a	specimen	at	6’2”	and	225	pounds,
but	he’d	been	sick	from	breakout	and	had	been	in	and	out	of	med	check	all
week."
Book 2,"While	twenty-five	of	us	stood	at	attention	on	the	pool	deck,	swollen,
chafed,	and	bleeding,	he	sat	on	the	stairs	by	the	pool,	jackhammering	in	the	cold."
Book 2,"He	looked	like	he	was	freezing,	but	waves	of	heat	poured	off	his	skin."
Book 2,"His	body
was	a	radiator	on	full	blast."
Book 2,I	could	feel	him	from	ten	feet	away.
Book 2,"I’d	had	double	pneumonia	during	my	first	Hell	Week	and	knew	what	it	looked
and	felt	like."
Book 2,"His	alveoli,	or	air	sacs,	were	filling	with	fluid."
Book 2,"He	couldn’t	clear
them	so	he	could	barely	breathe,	which	exacerbated	his	problem."
Book 2,"When
pneumonia	goes	uncontrolled,	it	can	lead	to	pulmonary	edema,	which	can	be
deadly,	and	he	was	halfway	there."
Book 2,"Sure	enough,	during	the	caterpillar	swim,	his	legs	went	limp	and	he	darted	to	the
bottom	of	the	pool	like	a	doll	stuffed	with	lead."
Book 2,"Two	instructors	jumped	in	after
him	and	from	there	it	was	chaos."
Book 2,"They	ordered	us	out	of	the	water	and	lined	us
up	along	the	fence	with	our	backs	facing	the	pool	as	medics	worked	to	revive
Mr.	Skop."
Book 2,We	heard	everything	and	knew	his	chances	were	slipping.
Book 2,"Fiveminutes	later,	he	still	wasn’t	breathing,	and	they	ordered	us	to	the	locker	room."
Book 2,"Mr.	Skop	was	transported	to	the	hospital	and	we	were	told	to	run	back	to	the
BUD/S	classroom."
Book 2,"We	didn’t	know	it	yet,	but	Hell	Week	was	already	over."
Book 2,"Minutes	later,	SBG	walked	in	and	delivered	the	news	cold."
Book 2,"“Mr.	Skop	is	dead,”	he	said."
Book 2,He	took	stock	of	the	room.
Book 2,"His	words	had	been	a
collective	gut	punch	to	men	who	were	already	on	the	knife’s	edge	after	nearly	a
week	with	no	sleep	and	no	relief."
Book 2,SBG	didn’t	give	a	fuck.
Book 2,"“This	is	the	world	you
live	in."
Book 2,"He’s	not	the	first	and	he	won’t	be	the	last	to	die	in	your	line	of	work.”	He
looked	over	at	Mr.	Skop’s	roommate	and	said,	“Mr.	Moore,	don’t	steal	any	of
his	shit.”	Then	he	left	the	room	like	it	was	just	another	fucked-up	day."
Book 2,"I	felt	torn	between	grief,	nausea,	and	relief."
Book 2,"I	was	sad	and	sick	to	my	stomach
that	Mr.	Skop	had	died,	but	we	were	all	relieved	to	have	survived	Hell	Week,
plus	the	way	SBG	handled	it	was	straight	ahead,	no	bullshit,	and	I	remember
thinking	if	all	SEALs	were	like	him,	this	would	definitely	be	the	world	for	me."
Book 2,Talk	about	mixed	emotions.
Book 2,"See,	most	civilians	don’t	understand	that	you	need	a	certain	level	of	callousness
to	do	the	job	we	were	being	trained	to	do."
Book 2,"To	live	in	a	brutal	world,	you	have	to
accept	cold-blooded	truths."
Book 2,I’m	not	saying	it’s	good.
Book 2,"I’m	not	necessarily	proud
of	it."
Book 2,But	special	ops	is	a	calloused	world	and	it	demands	a	calloused	mind.
Book 2,Hell	Week	had	ended	thirty-six	hours	early.
Book 2,"There	was	no	pizza	or	brown	shirt
ceremony	on	the	Grinder,	but	twenty-five	men	out	of	a	possible	156	had	made	it."
Book 2,"Once	again,	I	was	one	of	the	few,	and	once	again	I	was	swollen	like	a	Pillsbury
doughboy	and	on	crutches	with	twenty-one	weeks	of	training	still	to	come."
Book 2,"My
patella	was	intact,	but	both	of	my	shins	were	slivered	with	small	fractures."
Book 2,"It	gets
worse."
Book 2,"The	instructors	were	surly	because	they’d	been	forced	to	call	Hell	Week
prematurely,	so	they	ended	walk	week	after	just	forty-eight	hours."
Book 2,"By	every
conceivable	metric	I	was	fucked."
Book 2,"When	I	moved	my	ankle,	my	shins	were
activated	and	I	felt	searing	pain,	which	was	a	monumental	problem	because	a
typical	week	in	BUD/S	demands	up	to	sixty	miles	of	running."
Book 2,"Imagine	doing	that
on	two	broken	shins."
Book 2,"Most	of	the	guys	in	Class	235	lived	on	base	at	Naval	Special	Warfare	Command
in	Coronado."
Book 2,"I	lived	about	twenty	miles	away	in	a	$700	a	month	studio
apartment	with	a	mold	problem	in	Chula	Vista,	which	I	shared	with	my	pregnantwife	and	stepdaughter."
Book 2,"After	she	got	pregnant,	Pam	and	I	remarried,	I	financed	a
new	Honda	Passport—which	put	me	roughly	$60,000	in	debt—and	the	three	of
us	drove	out	from	Indiana	to	San	Diego	to	restart	our	family."
Book 2,"I’d	just	cleared
Hell	Week	for	the	second	time	in	a	calendar	year	and	she	was	set	to	deliver	our
baby	right	around	graduation,	but	there	was	no	happiness	in	my	head	or	my	soul."
Book 2,How	could	there	be?
Book 2,"We	lived	in	a	shithole	that	was	at	the	edge	of	affordability,
and	my	body	was	broken	once	again."
Book 2,"If	I	couldn’t	make	it	through	I	wouldn’t
even	be	able	to	afford	rent,	would	have	to	start	all	over,	and	find	a	new	line	of
work."
Book 2,I	could	not	and	would	not	let	that	happen.
Book 2,"The	night	before	First	Phase	kicked	back	up	in	intensity,	I	shaved	my	head	and
stared	into	my	reflection."
Book 2,"For	almost	two	years	straight	I’d	been	taking	pain	to
the	extreme	and	coming	back	for	more."
Book 2,"I’d	succeeded	in	spurts	only	to	be	buried
alive	in	failure."
Book 2,"That	night,	the	only	thing	that	allowed	me	to	continue	pushing
forward	was	the	knowledge	that	everything	I’d	been	through	had	helped	callous
my	mind."
Book 2,"The	question	was,	how	thick	was	the	callous?"
Book 2,"How	much	pain	could
one	man	take?"
Book 2,Did	I	have	it	in	me	to	run	on	broken	legs?
Book 2,I	woke	up	at	3:30	the	next	morning	and	drove	to	the	base.
Book 2,"I	limped	to	the	BUD/S
cage	where	we	kept	our	gear	and	slumped	onto	a	bench,	dropping	my	backpack
at	my	feet."
Book 2,"It	was	dark	as	hell	inside	and	out,	and	I	was	all	alone."
Book 2,"I	could	hear	the
rolling	surf	in	the	distance	as	I	dug	through	my	dive	bag."
Book 2,"Buried	beneath	my
dive	gear	were	two	rolls	of	duct	tape."
Book 2,"I	could	only	shake	my	head	and	smile	in
disbelief	as	I	grabbed	them,	knowing	how	insane	my	plan	was."
Book 2,I	carefully	pulled	a	thick	black	tube	sock	over	my	right	foot.
Book 2,"The	shin	was	tender
to	the	touch	and	even	the	slightest	twitch	of	the	ankle	joint	registered	high	on	the
suffering	scale."
Book 2,"From	there	I	looped	the	tape	around	my	heel	then	up	over	my
ankle	and	back	down	to	my	heel,	eventually	moving	both	down	the	foot	and	up
my	calf	until	my	entire	lower	leg	and	foot	were	wrapped	tight."
Book 2,"That	was	just	the
first	coat."
Book 2,"Then	I	put	another	black	tube	sock	on	and	taped	my	foot	and	ankle	the
same	way."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	was	done,	I	had	two	sock	layers	and	two	tape	layers,
and	once	my	foot	was	laced	up	in	the	boot,	my	ankle	and	shin	were	protected
and	immobilized."
Book 2,"Satisfied,	I	did	up	my	left	foot,	and	an	hour	later,	it	was	as
though	both	my	lower	legs	were	sunk	into	soft	casts."
Book 2,"It	still	hurt	to	walk,	but	the
torture	that	I’d	felt	when	my	ankle	moved	was	more	tolerable."
Book 2,"Or	at	least	I
thought	so."
Book 2,"I’d	find	out	for	sure	when	we	started	to	run.Our	first	training	run	that	day	was	my	trial	by	fire,	and	I	did	the	best	I	could	to
run	with	my	hip	flexors."
Book 2,Usually	we	let	our	feet	and	lower	legs	drive	the	rhythm.
Book 2,I	had	to	reverse	that.
Book 2,"It	took	intense	focus	to	isolate	each	movement	and	generate
motion	and	power	in	my	legs	from	the	hip	down,	and	for	the	first	thirty	minutes
the	pain	was	the	worst	I’d	ever	felt	in	my	life."
Book 2,"The	tape	cut	into	my	skin,	while
the	pounding	sent	shockwaves	of	agony	up	my	slivered	shins."
Book 2,"And	this	was	just	the	first	run	in	what	promised	to	be	five	months	of	continual
pain."
Book 2,"Was	it	possible	to	survive	this,	day	after	day?"
Book 2,I	thought	about	quitting.
Book 2,"If
failure	was	my	future	and	I’d	have	to	rethink	my	life	completely,	what	was	the
point	of	this	exercise?"
Book 2,Why	delay	the	inevitable?
Book 2,Was	I	fucked	in	the	head?
Book 2,"Each
and	every	thought	boiled	down	to	the	same	old	simple	question:	why?"
Book 2,"“The	only	way	to	guarantee	failure	is	to	quit	right	now,	motherfucker!”	I	was
talking	to	myself	now."
Book 2,"Silently	screaming	over	the	din	of	anguish	that	was
crushing	my	mind	and	soul."
Book 2,"“Take	the	pain,	or	it	won’t	just	be	your	failure."
Book 2,"It
will	be	your	family’s	failure!”
I	imagined	the	feeling	I	would	have	if	I	could	actually	pull	this	off."
Book 2,"If	I	could
endure	the	pain	required	to	complete	this	mission."
Book 2,"That	bought	me	another	half
mile	before	more	pain	rained	down	and	swirled	within	me	like	a	typhoon."
Book 2,"“People	have	a	hard	time	going	through	BUD/S	healthy,	and	you’re	going
through	it	on	broken	legs!	Who	else	would	even	think	of	this?”	I	asked."
Book 2,"“Who
else	would	be	able	to	run	even	one	minute	on	one	broken	leg,	let	alone	two?"
Book 2,"Only	Goggins!	You	are	twenty	minutes	in	the	business,	Goggins!	You	are	a
fucking	machine!	Each	step	you	run	from	now	until	the	end	will	only	make	you
harder!”
That	last	message	cracked	the	code	like	a	password."
Book 2,"My	calloused	mind	was	my
ticket	forward,	and	at	the	forty-minute	mark	something	remarkable	happened."
Book 2,The	pain	receded	to	low	tide.
Book 2,"The	tape	had	loosened	so	it	wasn’t	cutting	into	my
skin,	and	my	muscles	and	bones	were	warm	enough	to	take	some	pounding."
Book 2,"The
pain	would	come	and	go	throughout	the	day,	but	it	became	much	more
manageable,	and	when	the	pain	did	show	up,	I	told	myself	it	was	proof	of	how
tough	I	was	and	how	much	tougher	I	was	becoming."
Book 2,Day	after	day	the	same	ritual	played	itself	out.
Book 2,"I	showed	up	early,	duct	taped	myfeet,	endured	thirty	minutes	of	extreme	pain,	talked	myself	through	it,	and
survived."
Book 2,This	was	no	fake-it-till-you-make-it	bullshit.
Book 2,"To	me,	the	fact	that	I
showed	up	every	day	willing	to	put	myself	through	something	like	that	was	truly
amazing."
Book 2,The	instructors	rewarded	me	for	it	too.
Book 2,"They	offered	to	bind	my	hands
and	feet	and	throw	me	in	the	pool	to	see	if	I	could	swim	four	fucking	laps."
Book 2,"In
fact,	they	didn’t	offer."
Book 2,They	insisted.
Book 2,"This	was	one	part	of	an	evolution	they
liked	to	call	Drown	Proofing."
Book 2,"I	preferred	to	call	it	controlled	drowning!
With	our	hands	bound	behind	us	and	feet	tied	behind	our	back,	all	we	could	do	is
dolphin	kick,	and	unlike	some	of	the	experienced	swimmers	in	our	class,	who
looked	like	they’d	been	pulled	from	the	Michael	Phelps	gene	pool,	my	dolphin
kick	was	that	of	a	stationary	rocking	horse	and	provided	about	the	same
propulsion."
Book 2,"I	was	continually	out	of	breath,	fighting	to	stay	near	the	surface,
chicken	necking	my	head	above	the	water	to	get	a	breath,	only	to	sink	down	and
kick	hard,	trying	in	vain	to	find	momentum."
Book 2,I’d	practiced	for	this.
Book 2,"For	weeks,	I’d
hit	the	pool	and	even	experimented	with	wetsuit	shorts	to	see	if	I	could	hide
them	under	my	uniform	to	provide	some	buoyancy."
Book 2,"They	made	it	look	like	I	was
wearing	a	diaper	under	the	tight-ass-nut-hugging	UDT	shorts,	and	they	didn’t
help,	but	all	that	practice	did	get	me	comfortable	enough	with	the	feeling	of
drowning	that	I	was	able	to	endure	and	pass	that	test."
Book 2,"We	had	another	brutal	underwater	evolution	in	Second	Phase,	aka	dive	phase."
Book 2,"Again,	it	involved	treading	water,	which	always	sounds	basic	as	hell	whenever	I
write	it,	but	for	this	drill	we	were	fitted	with	fully-charged,	twin	eighty-liter
tanks	and	a	sixteen-pound	weight	belt."
Book 2,"We	had	fins,	but	kicking	with	fins
increased	the	pain	quotient	and	stress	on	my	ankles	and	shins."
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	tape	up
for	the	water."
Book 2,I	had	to	suck	up	the	pain.
Book 2,After	that	we	had	to	swim	on	our	backs	for	fifty	meters	without	sinking.
Book 2,"Then
flip	over	and	swim	fifty	meters	on	our	stomach,	once	again	staying	on	the
surface,	all	while	being	fully	loaded!	We	weren’t	allowed	to	use	any	flotation
devices	whatsoever,	and	keeping	our	heads	up	caused	intense	pain	in	our	necks,
shoulders,	hips,	and	lower	backs."
Book 2,The	noises	coming	out	of	the	pool	that	day	are	something	I’ll	never	forget.
Book 2,"Our
desperate	attempts	to	stay	afloat	and	breathe	conjured	an	audible	mixture	of
terror,	frustration,	and	exertion."
Book 2,"We	were	gurgling,	grunting,	and	gasping."
Book 2,"I
heard	guttural	screams	and	high-pitched	squeals."
Book 2,"Several	guys	sank	to	thebottom,	took	off	their	weight	belts,	and	slipped	free	of	their	tanks,	letting	them
crash	to	the	floor	of	the	pool,	then	jetted	to	the	surface."
Book 2,Only	one	man	passed	that	evolution	on	the	first	try.
Book 2,"We	only	got	three	chances	to
pass	any	given	evolution	and	it	took	me	all	three	to	pass	that	one."
Book 2,"On	my	last
attempt	I	focused	on	long,	fluid	scissor	kicks,	again	using	my	overworked	hip
flexors."
Book 2,I	barely	made	it.
Book 2,"By	the	time	we	got	to	Third	Phase,	the	land	warfare	training	module	on	San
Clemente	Island,	my	legs	were	healed	up,	and	I	knew	I’d	make	it	through	to
graduation,	but	just	because	it	was	the	last	lap	doesn’t	mean	it	was	easy."
Book 2,"At	the
main	BUD/S	compound	on	The	Strand,	you	get	lots	of	looky-loos	coming
through."
Book 2,"Officers	of	all	stripes	stop	in	to	watch	training,	which	means	there	are
people	peering	over	the	instructors’	shoulders."
Book 2,"On	the	island,	it’s	just	you	and
them."
Book 2,"They	are	free	to	get	nasty,	and	they	show	no	mercy."
Book 2,"Which	is	exactly	why
I	loved	the	island!
One	afternoon	we	split	into	teams	of	two	and	three	guys	to	build	hide	sites	that
blend	in	with	the	vegetation."
Book 2,"We	were	coming	down	to	the	end	by	then,	and
everyone	was	in	killer	shape	and	unafraid."
Book 2,"Guys	were	getting	sloppy	with	their
attention	to	detail	and	the	instructors	were	pissed	off,	so	they	called	everyone
down	into	a	valley	to	give	us	a	classic	beat	down."
Book 2,"There	would	be	push-ups,	sit-ups,	flutter	kicks,	and	eight-count	bodybuilders
(advanced	burpees)	galore."
Book 2,"But	first	they	told	us	to	kneel	down	and	dig	holes
with	our	hands,	large	enough	to	bury	ourselves	up	to	the	neck	for	some
unspecified	length	of	time."
Book 2,"I	was	smiling	my	ass	off	and	digging	deep	when	one
of	the	instructors	came	up	with	a	new,	creative	way	to	torture	me."
Book 2,"“Goggins,	get	up."
Book 2,"You	like	this	shit	too	much.”	I	laughed	and	kept	digging,	but
he	was	serious."
Book 2,"“I	said	get	up,	Goggins."
Book 2,"You’re	getting	way	too	much	pleasure.”
I	stood	up,	stepped	to	the	side,	and	watched	my	classmates	suffer	for	the	next
thirty	minutes	without	me."
Book 2,"From	then	on	the	instructors	stopped	including	me	in
their	beat	downs."
Book 2,"When	the	class	was	ordered	to	do	push-ups,	sit-ups,	or	get	wet
and	sandy,	they’d	always	exclude	me."
Book 2,"I	took	it	as	a	point	of	pride	that	I’d	finally
broken	the	will	of	the	entire	BUD/S	staff,	but	I	also	missed	the	beat	downs."
Book 2,Because	I	saw	them	as	opportunities	to	callous	my	mind.
Book 2,"Now,	they	were	overfor	me."
Book 2,"Considering	that	the	Grinder	was	center	stage	for	a	lot	of	Navy	SEAL	training,	it
makes	sense	that’s	where	BUD/S	graduation	is	held."
Book 2,Families	fly	in.
Book 2,"Fathers	and
brothers	puff	their	chests	out;	mothers,	wives,	and	girlfriends	are	all	done	up	and
drop	dead	gorgeous."
Book 2,"Instead	of	pain	and	misery,	it	was	all	smiles	on	that	patch	of
asphalt	as	the	graduates	of	Class	235	mustered	up	in	our	dress	whites	beneath	a
huge	American	flag	billowing	in	the	sea	breeze."
Book 2,"To	our	right	was	the	infamous
bell	that	130	of	our	classmates	tolled	in	order	to	quit	what	is	arguably	the	most
challenging	training	in	the	military."
Book 2,"Each	of	us	was	introduced	and
acknowledged	individually."
Book 2,"My	mother	had	tears	of	joy	in	her	eyes	when	my
name	was	called,	but	strangely,	I	didn’t	feel	much	of	anything,	except	sadness.Coronado—my	teammates	beamed	with	pride	as	they	gathered	to	take	photos
with	their	families."
Book 2,"At	the	bar,	music	blared	while	everyone	got	drunk	and	raised
hell	like	they’d	just	won	something."
Book 2,"And	to	be	honest,	that	shit	annoyed	me."
Book 2,Because	I	was	sorry	to	see	BUD/S	go.
Book 2,"When	I	first	locked	in	on	the	SEALs,	I	was	looking	for	an	arena	that	would
either	destroy	me	completely	or	make	me	unbreakable."
Book 2,BUD/S	provided	that.
Book 2,"It
showed	me	what	the	human	mind	is	capable	of,	and	how	to	harness	it	to	take
more	pain	than	I’d	ever	felt	before,	so	I	could	learn	to	achieve	things	I	never
even	knew	were	possible."
Book 2,Like	running	on	broken	legs.
Book 2,"After	graduation	it
would	be	up	to	me	to	continue	to	hunt	impossible	tasks	because	though	it	was	an
accomplishment	to	become	just	the	thirty-sixth	African	American	BUD/S
graduate	in	Navy	SEAL	history,	my	quest	to	defy	the	odds	had	only	just	begun!CHALLENGE	#5
It’s	time	to	visualize!	Again,	the	average	person	thinks	2,000–3,000	thoughts	per
hour."
Book 2,"Rather	than	focusing	on	bullshit	you	cannot	change,	imagine	visualizing
the	things	you	can."
Book 2,"Choose	any	obstacle	in	your	way,	or	set	a	new	goal,	and
visualize	overcoming	or	achieving	it."
Book 2,"Before	I	engage	in	any	challenging
activity,	I	start	by	painting	a	picture	of	what	my	success	looks	and	feels	like."
Book 2,"I’ll
think	about	it	every	day	and	that	feeling	propels	me	forward	when	I’m	training,
competing,	or	taking	on	any	task	I	choose."
Book 2,"But	visualization	isn’t	simply	about	daydreaming	of	some	trophy	ceremony—
real	or	metaphorical."
Book 2,"You	must	also	visualize	the	challenges	that	are	likely	to
arise	and	determine	how	you	will	attack	those	problems	when	they	do."
Book 2,"That	way
you	can	be	as	prepared	as	possible	on	the	journey."
Book 2,"When	I	show	up	for	a	foot
race	now,	I	drive	the	entire	course	first,	visualizing	success	but	also	potential
challenges,	which	helps	me	control	my	thought	process."
Book 2,"You	can’t	prepare	for
everything	but	if	you	engage	in	strategic	visualization	ahead	of	time,	you’ll	be	as
prepared	as	you	possibly	can	be."
Book 2,That	also	means	being	prepared	to	answer	the	simple	questions.
Book 2,"Why	are	you
doing	this?"
Book 2,What	is	driving	you	toward	this	achievement?
Book 2,"Where	does	the
darkness	you’re	using	as	fuel	come	from?"
Book 2,What	has	calloused	your	mind?
Book 2,"You’ll
need	to	have	those	answers	at	your	fingertips	when	you	hit	a	wall	of	pain	and
doubt."
Book 2,"To	push	through,	you’ll	need	to	channel	your	darkness,	feed	off	it,	and
lean	on	your	calloused	mind."
Book 2,"Remember,	visualization	will	never	compensate	for	work	undone."
Book 2,"You	cannot
visualize	lies."
Book 2,"All	the	strategies	I	employ	to	answer	the	simple	questions	and	win
the	mind	game	are	only	effective	because	I	put	in	work."
Book 2,"It’s	a	lot	more	than	mind
over	matter."
Book 2,"It	takes	relentless	self-discipline	to	schedule	suffering	into	your	day,
every	day,	but	if	you	do,	you’ll	find	that	at	the	other	end	of	that	suffering	is	a
whole	other	life	just	waiting	for	you."
Book 2,"This	challenge	doesn’t	have	to	be	physical,	and	victory	doesn’t	always	mean	you
came	in	first	place."
Book 2,It	can	mean	you’ve	finally	overcome	a	lifelong	fear	or	anyother	obstacle	that	made	you	surrender	in	the	past.
Book 2,"Whatever	it	is,	tell	the	world
your	story	about	how	you	created	your	#armoredmind	and	where	it’s	taken	you.CHAPTER	SIX
6."
Book 2,"IT’S	NOT	ABOUT	A	TROPHY
Everything	about	the	race	was	going	better	than	I	could	have	hoped."
Book 2,"There	were
enough	clouds	in	the	sky	to	blunt	the	heat	of	the	sun,	my	rhythm	was	as	steady
as	the	mellow	tide	that	sloshed	against	the	hulls	of	sailboats	docked	in	the	nearby
San	Diego	Marina,	and	though	my	legs	felt	heavy,	that	was	to	be	expected
considering	my	“tapering“	plan	the	night	before."
Book 2,"Besides,	they	seemed	to	be
loosening	up	as	I	rounded	a	bend	to	complete	my	ninth	lap—my	ninth	mile—
just	an	hour	and	change	into	a	twenty-four-hour	race."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	saw	John	Metz,	race	director	of	the	San	Diego	One	Day,
eyeballing	me	at	the	start-finish	line."
Book 2,"He	was	holding	up	his	white	board	to
inform	each	competitor	of	their	time	and	position	in	the	overall	field."
Book 2,"I	was	in
fifth	place,	which	evidently	confused	him."
Book 2,"I	offered	a	crisp	nod	to	reassure	him
that	I	knew	what	I	was	doing,	that	I	was	right	where	I	was	supposed	to	be."
Book 2,He	saw	through	that	shit.
Book 2,Metz	was	a	veteran.
Book 2,Always	polite	and	soft-spoken.
Book 2,"It	didn’t	look	like	there	was
much	that	could	faze	him,	but	he	was	also	a	seasoned	ultra-marathoner	with
three	fifty-mile	races	in	his	saddlebag."
Book 2,"He’d	either	reached	or	topped	a	hundred
miles,	seven	times,	and	he’d	achieved	his	personal	best	of	144	miles	in	twenty-
four	hours	when	he	was	fifty	years	old!	Which	is	why	it	meant	something	to	me
that	he	looked	concerned."
Book 2,"I	checked	my	watch,	synced	to	a	heart	rate	monitor	I	wore	around	my	chest."
Book 2,"My
pulse	straddled	my	magic	number	line:	145."
Book 2,"A	few	days	earlier	I’d	run	into	my
old	BUD/S	instructor,	SBG,	at	Naval	Special	Warfare	Command."
Book 2,"Most	SEALs
do	rotations	as	instructors	between	deployments,	and	SBG	and	I	worked
together."
Book 2,"When	I	told	him	about	the	San	Diego	One	Day	he	insisted	I	wear	a
heart	rate	monitor	to	pace	myself."
Book 2,"SBG	was	a	big	geek	when	it	came	to
performance	and	recovery,	and	I	watched	as	he	scratched	out	a	few	formulas,
then	turned	to	me	and	said,	“Keep	your	pulse	steady	between	140	and	145	andyou’ll	be	golden.”	The	next	day	he	handed	me	a	heart	rate	monitor	as	a	race	day
gift."
Book 2,"If	you	set	out	to	mark	a	course	that	could	crack	open	a	Navy	SEAL	like	a
walnut,	chew	him	up,	and	spit	him	the	fuck	out,	San	Diego’s	Hospitality	Point
would	not	make	the	cut."
Book 2,"We’re	talking	about	terrain	so	vanilla	it’s	downright
serene."
Book 2,"Tourists	descend	year-round	for	views	of	San	Diego’s	stunning	marina,
which	spills	into	Mission	Bay."
Book 2,"The	road	is	almost	entirely	smooth	asphalt	and
perfectly	flat,	save	a	brief	seven-foot	incline	with	the	pitch	of	a	standard
suburban	driveway."
Book 2,"There	are	manicured	lawns,	palm	trees,	and	shade	trees."
Book 2,"Hospitality	Point	is	so	inviting	that	disabled	and	convalescing	folks	head	there
with	their	walkers	for	an	afternoon’s	rehab	stroll,	all	the	time."
Book 2,"But	the	day	after
John	Metz	chalked	his	easy,	one-mile	course,	it	became	the	scene	of	my	total
destruction."
Book 2,I	should	have	known	that	a	breakdown	was	coming.
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	started
running	at	10	a.m.	on	November	12,	2005,	I	hadn’t	run	more	than	a	mile	in	six
months,	but	I	looked	like	I	was	fit	because	I’d	never	stopped	hitting	the	gym."
Book 2,"While	I	was	stationed	in	Iraq,	on	my	second	deployment	with	SEAL	Team	Five
earlier	that	year,	I’d	gotten	back	into	serious	power	lifting,	and	my	only	dose	of
cardio	was	twenty	minutes	on	the	elliptical	once	a	week."
Book 2,"The	point	is,	my
cardiovascular	fitness	was	an	absolute	joke,	and	still	I	thought	it	was	a	brilliant
idea	to	try	and	run	a	hundred	miles	in	twenty-four	hours."
Book 2,"Okay,	it	was	always	a	fucked-up	idea,	but	I	considered	it	doable	because	a
hundred	miles	in	twenty-four	hours	demands	a	pace	of	just	under	fifteen	minutes
a	mile."
Book 2,"If	it	came	to	it,	I	figured	I	could	walk	that	fast."
Book 2,"Only,	I	didn’t	walk."
Book 2,"When
that	horn	sounded	at	the	start	of	the	race,	I	took	off	hot	and	zoomed	to	the	front
of	the	pack."
Book 2,Exactly	the	right	move	if	your	race-day	goal	is	to	blow	the	fuck	up.
Book 2,"Also,	I	didn’t	exactly	come	in	well-rested."
Book 2,"The	night	before	the	race,	I	passed	by
the	SEAL	Team	Five	gym	on	my	way	off	base	after	work,	and	peeked	in	like	I
always	did,	just	to	see	who	was	getting	after	it."
Book 2,"SBG	was	inside	warming	up,	and
called	out."
Book 2,"“Goggins,”	he	said,	“let’s	jack	some	fucking	steel!”	I	laughed."
Book 2,"He	stared	me
down."
Book 2,"“You	know,	Goggins,”	he	said,	stepping	closer,	“when	the	Vikings	were
getting	ready	to	raid	a	fucking	village,	and	they	were	camped	out	in	the	fuckingwoods	in	their	goddam	tents	made	out	of	fucking	deer	hides	and	shit,	sitting
around	a	campfire,	do	you	think	they	said,	Hey,	let’s	have	some	herbal	fucking
tea	and	call	it	an	early	night?"
Book 2,"Or	were	they	more	like,	Fuck	that,	we	are	going	to
drink	some	vodka	made	out	of	some	mushrooms	and	get	all	drunked	up,	so	the
next	morning	when	they	were	all	hung-over	and	pissed	off	they	would	be	in	the
ideal	mood	to	slaughter	the	shit	out	of	some	people?”
SBG	could	be	a	funny	motherfucker	when	he	wanted	to	be,	and	he	could	see	me
wavering,	considering	my	options."
Book 2,"On	the	one	hand,	that	man	would	always	be
my	BUD/S	instructor	and	he	was	one	of	the	few	instructors	who	was	still	hard,
putting	out,	and	living	the	SEAL	ethos	every	day."
Book 2,"I’ll	always	want	to	impress
him."
Book 2,"Jacking	weights	the	night	before	my	first	100	mile	race	would	definitely
impress	that	masochistic	motherfucker."
Book 2,"Plus,	his	logic	made	some	fucked-up
sense	to	me."
Book 2,"I	needed	to	get	my	mind	ready	to	go	to	war,	and	lifting	heavy	would
be	my	way	of	saying,	bring	on	all	your	pain	and	misery,	I’m	ready	to	go!	But,
honestly,	who	does	that	before	running	a	hundred	fucking	miles?"
Book 2,"I	shook	my	head	in	disbelief,	threw	my	bag	to	the	ground	and	started	racking
weights."
Book 2,"With	heavy	metal	blaring	from	the	speakers,	two	knuckle	draggers
came	together	to	put	the	fuck	out."
Book 2,"Most	of	our	work	focused	on	the	legs,
including	long	sets	of	squats	and	dead	lifts	at	315	pounds."
Book 2,"In	between	we	bench
pressed	225."
Book 2,"This	was	a	real	deal	power-lifting	session,	and	afterwards	we	sat	on
the	bench	next	to	one	another	and	watched	our	quads	and	hamstrings	quiver."
Book 2,"It
was	fucking	funny…until	it	wasn’t."
Book 2,"Ultra	running	has	gone	at	least	somewhat	mainstream	since	then,	but	in	2005,
most	ultra	races—especially	the	San	Diego	One	Day—were	pretty	obscure,	and
it	was	all	new	to	me."
Book 2,"When	the	majority	of	people	think	of	ultras	they	picture
trail	runs	through	remote	wilderness	and	don’t	often	imagine	circuit	races,	but
there	were	some	serious	runners	in	the	field	at	the	San	Diego	One	Day."
Book 2,"This	was	the	American	National	24-Hour	Championship	and	athletes	descended
from	all	over	the	country	hoping	for	a	trophy,	a	place	on	the	podium,	and	the
modest	winner-take-all	cash	prize	of,	ahem,	$2,000."
Book 2,"No,	this	was	not	a	gilded
event,	basking	in	corporate	sponsorship,	but	it	was	the	site	for	a	team	comp
between	the	U.S.	ultra-distance	national	team	and	a	team	from	Japan."
Book 2,"Each	side
fielded	teams	of	four	men	and	four	women	who	each	ran	for	twenty-four	hours."
Book 2,One	of	the	top	individual	athletes	in	the	field	was	also	from	Japan.
Book 2,"Her	namewas	Ms.	Inagaki,	and	early	on	she	and	I	kept	pace."
Book 2,"Ms.	Inagaki	and	I	during	San	Diego	100
SBG	turned	up	to	cheer	me	on	that	morning	with	his	wife	and	two-year-old	son."
Book 2,"They	huddled	up	on	the	sidelines	with	my	new	wife,	Kate,	who	I’d	married	a
few	months	before,	a	little	over	two	years	after	my	second	divorce	from	Pam
was	finalized."
Book 2,"When	they	saw	me,	they	couldn’t	help	but	double	over	in
laughter."
Book 2,"Not	just	because	SBG	was	still	beat	up	from	our	workout	the	night
before,	and	here	I	was	trying	to	run	a	hundred	miles,	but	because	of	how	out	of
place	I	looked."
Book 2,"When	I	spoke	to	SBG	about	it	not	long	ago,	the	scene	still	made
him	laugh."
Book 2,"“So	ultra	marathoners	are	a	little	weird,	right,”	SBG	said,	“and	that	morning	it
was	like	there	were	all	these	skinny	ass,	college	professor	looking,	fucking
granola	eating	weirdoes,	and	then	there	is	this	one	big	black	dude	who	looks	like
a	fucking	linebacker	from	the	Raiders,	running	around	this	track	jacked	the	fuck
up	with	no	shirt	on,	and	I’m	thinking	of	that	song	we	had	in	kindergarten…onehad	twenty	more	hours	and	nearly	three	more	marathons	to	go."
Book 2,"Those	were
incomprehensible	metrics,	with	no	traditional	milestone	in	between	to	focus	on."
Book 2,"I
was	running	across	the	sky."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	started	thinking	that	this	could	end
badly."
Book 2,Metz	didn’t	stop	trying	to	help.
Book 2,"Each	mile	he’d	run	alongside	and	check	on	me,
and	me	being	who	I	am,	I	told	him	that	I	had	everything	under	control	and	had	it
all	figured	out."
Book 2,Which	was	true.
Book 2,"I’d	figured	out	that	John	Metz	knew	what	the
fuck	he	was	talking	about."
Book 2,"Oh	yes,	the	pain	was	becoming	real."
Book 2,"My	quads	throbbed,	my	feet	were	chafed
and	bleeding,	and	that	simple	question	was	once	again	bubbling	up	in	my	frontal
lobe."
Book 2,Why?
Book 2,Why	run	a	hundred	fucking	miles	without	training?
Book 2,"Why	was	I	doing
this	to	myself?"
Book 2,"Fair	questions,	especially	since	I	hadn’t	even	heard	of	the	San
Diego	One	Day	until	three	days	before	race	day,	but	this	time	my	answer	was
different."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	on	Hospitality	Point	to	deal	with	my	own	demons	or	to	prove
anything	at	all."
Book 2,I	came	with	a	purpose	bigger	than	David	Goggins.
Book 2,"This	fight	was
about	my	once	and	future	fallen	teammates,	and	the	families	they	leave	behind
when	shit	goes	wrong."
Book 2,Or	at	least	that’s	what	I	told	myself	at	mile	twenty-seven.
Book 2,"***
I	had	gotten	the	news	about	Operation	Red	Wings,	a	doomed	operation	in	the
remote	mountains	of	Afghanistan,	on	my	last	day	of	U.S.	Army	Freefall	school
in	Yuma,	Arizona,	in	June."
Book 2,"Operation	Red	Wings	was	a	four-man
reconnaissance	mission	tasked	with	gathering	intelligence	on	a	growing	pro-
Taliban	force	in	a	region	called	Sawtalo	Sar."
Book 2,"If	successful,	what	they	learned
would	help	define	strategy	for	a	larger	offensive	in	the	coming	weeks."
Book 2,"I	knew	all
four	guys."
Book 2,Danny	Dietz	was	in	BUD/S	Class	231	with	me.
Book 2,"He	got	injured	and	rolled	just
like	I	did."
Book 2,"Michael	Murphy,	the	OIC	of	the	mission,	was	with	me	in	Class	235
before	he	got	rolled."
Book 2,"Matthew	Axelson	was	in	my	Hooyah	Class	when	I
graduated	(more	on	the	Hooyah	Class	tradition	in	a	moment),	and	Marcus
Luttrell	was	one	of	the	first	people	I	met	on	my	original	lap	through	BUD/S.Before	training	begins,	each	incoming	BUD/S	class	throws	a	party,	and	the	guys
from	previous	classes	who	are	still	in	BUD/S	training	are	always	invited."
Book 2,"The
idea	is	to	juice	as	much	information	from	brown	shirts	as	possible,	because	you
never	know	what	might	help	get	you	through	a	crucial	evolution	that	could	make
all	the	difference	between	graduation	and	failure."
Book 2,"Marcus	was	6’4”,	225	pounds,
and	he	stuck	out	in	that	crowd	like	I	did."
Book 2,"I	was	a	bigger	guy	too,	back	up	to	210
by	then,	and	he	sought	me	out."
Book 2,In	some	ways	we	were	an	odd	pair.
Book 2,"He	was	a
hard-ass	axe	handle	from	the	Texas	rangeland,	and	I	was	a	self-made	masochist
from	the	Indiana	cornfields,	but	he’d	heard	I	was	a	good	runner,	and	running	was
his	main	weakness."
Book 2,"“Goggins,	do	you	have	any	tips	for	me?”	he	asked."
Book 2,"“Because	I	can’t	run	for
shit.”
I	knew	Marcus	was	a	badass,	but	his	humility	made	him	real."
Book 2,"When	he	graduated
a	few	days	later,	we	were	his	Hooyah	Class,	which	meant	we	were	the	first
people	they	were	allowed	to	order	around."
Book 2,"They	embraced	that	SEAL	tradition
and	told	us	to	go	get	wet	and	sandy."
Book 2,"It	was	a	SEAL’s	rite	of	passage,	and	an
honor	to	share	that	with	him."
Book 2,After	that	I	didn’t	see	him	for	a	long	time.
Book 2,"I	thought	I	ran	into	him	again	when	I	was	about	to	graduate	with	Class	235,	but
it	was	his	twin	brother,	Morgan	Luttrell,	who	was	part	of	my	Hooyah	Class,
Class	237,	along	with	Matthew	Axelson."
Book 2,"We	could	have	ordered	up	some	poetic
justice,	but	after	we	graduated,	instead	of	telling	their	class	to	go	get	wet	and
sandy,	we	put	ourselves	in	the	surf,	in	our	dress	whites!
I	had	something	to	do	with	that."
Book 2,"In	the	Navy	SEALs,	you	are	either	deployed	and	operating	in	the	field,
instructing	other	SEALs,	or	in	school	yourself,	learning	or	perfecting	skills."
Book 2,"We
cycle	through	more	military	schools	than	most	because	we	are	trained	to	do	it
all,	but	when	I	went	through	BUD/S	we	didn’t	learn	to	freefall."
Book 2,"We	jumped	by
static	lines,	which	deployed	our	chutes	automatically."
Book 2,"Back	then	you	had	to	be
chosen	to	attend	U.S.	Army	Freefall	School."
Book 2,"After	my	second	platoon,	I	was
picked	up	for	Green	Team	which	is	one	of	the	training	phases	to	get	accepted
into	the	Naval	Special	Warfare	Development	Group	(DEVGRU),	an	elite	unit
within	the	SEALs.	That	required	me	to	get	freefall	qualified."
Book 2,"It	also	required	that
I	face	my	fear	of	heights	in	the	most	confrontational	way	possible.We	started	off	in	the	classrooms	and	wind	tunnels	of	Fort	Bragg,	North	Carolina,
which	is	where	I	reconnected	with	Morgan	in	2005."
Book 2,"Floating	on	a	bed	of
compressed	air	in	a	fifteen-foot-high	wind	tunnel,	we	learned	correct	body
position,	how	to	shift	left	and	right,	and	push	forward	and	back."
Book 2,"It	takes	very
small	movements	with	your	palm	to	move	and	it’s	easy	to	start	spinning	out	of
control,	which	is	never	good."
Book 2,"Not	everyone	could	master	those	subtleties	but
those	of	us	who	could	left	Fort	Bragg	after	that	first	week	of	training	and	headed
to	an	airstrip	in	the	cactus	fields	of	Yuma	to	start	jumping	for	real."
Book 2,"Morgan	and	I	trained	and	hung	out	together	for	four	weeks	in	the	127-degree
desert	heat	of	summer."
Book 2,"We	did	dozens	of	jumps	out	of	C130	transport	jets	from
altitudes	ranging	from	12,500	to	19,000	feet,	and	there	is	no	rush	like	the	surge
of	adrenaline	and	paranoia	that	comes	with	plummeting	to	earth	from	high
altitude	at	terminal	velocity."
Book 2,"Each	time	we	jumped	I	couldn’t	help	but	think	of
Scott	Gearen,	the	Pararescuman	who	survived	a	botched	jump	from	high	altitude
and	inspired	me	on	this	path	when	I	met	him	as	a	high	school	student."
Book 2,"He	was	a
constant	presence	for	me	in	that	desert,	and	a	cautionary	tale."
Book 2,"Proof	that
something	can	go	horribly	wrong	on	any	given	jump."
Book 2,"When	I	jumped	out	of	an	airplane	for	the	first	time	from	high	altitude,	all	I	felt
was	extreme	fear,	and	I	couldn’t	pry	my	eyes	from	my	altimeter."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	able	to
embrace	the	jump	because	fear	had	clogged	my	mind."
Book 2,"All	I	could	think	about
was	whether	or	not	my	canopy	would	open."
Book 2,"I	was	missing	the	unbelievable
thrill-ride	of	the	freefall,	the	beauty	of	the	mountains	painted	against	the	horizon,
and	the	wide-open	sky."
Book 2,"But	as	I	became	conditioned	to	the	risk,	my	tolerance	for
that	same	fear	increased."
Book 2,"It	was	always	there,	but	I	was	used	to	the	discomfort
and	before	long	I	was	able	to	handle	multiple	tasks	on	a	jump	and	appreciate	the
moment	too."
Book 2,"Seven	years	earlier	I	had	been	rooting	around	fast	food	kitchens
and	open	dumpsters	zapping	vermin."
Book 2,"Now	I	was	fucking	flying!
The	final	task	in	Yuma	was	a	midnight	jump	in	full	kit."
Book 2,"We	were	weighed	down
with	a	fifty-pound	rucksack,	strapped	with	a	rifle	and	an	oxygen	mask	for	the
freefall."
Book 2,"We	were	also	equipped	with	chem	lights,	which	were	a	necessity
because	when	the	back	ramp	of	the	C-130	opened	up,	it	was	pitch	black."
Book 2,"We	couldn’t	see	any	damn	thing,	but	still	we	leapt	into	that	moonless	sky,	eight
of	us	in	a	line,	one	after	another."
Book 2,"We	were	supposed	to	form	an	arrow,	and	as	I
maneuvered	through	the	real-world	wind	tunnel	to	take	my	place	in	the	granddesign,	all	I	could	see	were	swerving	lights	streaking	like	comets	in	an	inkwell
sky."
Book 2,My	goggles	fogged	up	as	the	wind	ripped	through	me.
Book 2,"We	fell	for	a	full
minute,	and	when	we	deployed	our	chutes	at	around	4,000	feet,	the
overpowering	sound	went	from	full	tornado	to	eerie	silence."
Book 2,"It	was	so	quiet	I
could	hear	my	heart	beat	through	my	chest."
Book 2,"It	was	fucking	bliss,	and	when	we	all
landed	safely,	we	were	freefall	qualified!	We	had	no	idea	that	at	that	moment,	in
the	mountains	of	Afghanistan,	Marcus	and	his	team	were	locked	into	an	all-out
battle	for	their	lives,	at	the	center	of	what	would	become	the	worst	incident	in
SEAL	history."
Book 2,One	of	the	best	things	about	Yuma	is	that	you	have	horrible	cell	service.
Book 2,"I’m	not
big	on	texting	or	talking	on	the	phone	so	this	gave	me	four	weeks	of	peace."
Book 2,"When	you	graduate	any	military	school,	the	last	thing	you	do	is	clean	all	the
areas	your	class	used	until	it’s	like	you	were	never	there."
Book 2,"My	cleaning	detail	was
in	charge	of	the	bathrooms,	which	happened	to	be	one	of	the	only	places	in
Yuma	that	has	cell	service,	and	as	soon	as	I	walked	in	I	could	hear	my	phone
blow	up."
Book 2,"Text	messages	about	Operation	Red	Wings	going	bad	flooded	in,	and
as	I	read	them	my	soul	broke."
Book 2,"Morgan	hadn’t	heard	anything	about	it	yet,	so	I
walked	outside,	found	him,	and	told	him	the	news."
Book 2,I	had	to.
Book 2,"Marcus	and	his	crew
were	all	MIA	and	presumed	KIA."
Book 2,"He	nodded,	considered	it	for	a	second,	and
said,	“My	brother’s	not	dead.”
Morgan	is	seven	minutes	older	than	Marcus."
Book 2,"They	were	inseparable	as	kids,	and
the	first	time	they’d	ever	been	apart	for	longer	than	a	day	was	when	Marcus
joined	the	Navy."
Book 2,"Morgan	opted	for	college	before	joining	up,	and	during
Marcus’	Hell	Week,	he	tried	to	stay	up	the	whole	time	in	solidarity."
Book 2,"He	wanted
and	needed	to	share	that	feeling,	but	there	is	no	such	thing	as	a	Hell	Week
simulation."
Book 2,"You	have	to	go	through	it	to	know	it,	and	those	that	survive	are
forever	changed."
Book 2,"In	fact,	the	period	after	Marcus	survived	Hell	Week	and	before
Morgan	became	a	SEAL	himself	was	the	only	time	there	was	any	emotional
distance	between	the	brothers,	which	speaks	to	the	power	of	those	130	hours	and
their	emotional	toll."
Book 2,"Once	Morgan	went	through	it	for	real,	everything	was	right
again."
Book 2,They	each	have	half	a	Trident	tattooed	on	their	back.
Book 2,"The	picture	is	only
complete	when	they	stand	side	by	side."
Book 2,"Morgan	took	off	immediately	to	drive	to	San	Diego	and	figure	out	what	the	hell
was	going	on."
Book 2,"He	still	hadn’t	heard	anything	about	the	operation	directly,	but
once	he	reached	civilization	and	his	service	hit,	a	tide	of	messages	flooded	hisphone	too."
Book 2,"He	floored	his	rental	car	to	120	mph	and	zoomed	directly	to	the	base
in	Coronado."
Book 2,Morgan	knew	all	the	guys	in	his	brother’s	unit	well.
Book 2,"Axelson	was	his	classmate
in	BUD/S,	and	as	facts	trickled	in	it	was	obvious	to	most	that	his	brother
wouldn’t	be	found	alive."
Book 2,"I	thought	he	was	gone	too,	but	you	know	what	they	say
about	twins."
Book 2,"“I	knew	my	brother	was	out	there,	alive,”	Morgan	told	me	when	we	connected
again	in	April	2018."
Book 2,"“I	said	that	the	whole	time.”
I’d	called	Morgan	to	talk	about	old	times	and	asked	him	about	the	hardest	week
in	his	life."
Book 2,"From	San	Diego,	he	flew	out	to	his	family’s	ranch	in	Huntsville,
Texas,	where	they	were	getting	updates	twice	a	day."
Book 2,"Dozens	of	fellow	SEALs
turned	up	to	show	support,	Morgan	said,	and	for	five	long	days,	he	and	his
family	cried	themselves	to	sleep	at	night."
Book 2,"To	them	it	was	torture	knowing	that
Marcus	might	be	alive	and	alone	in	hostile	territory."
Book 2,"When	officials	from	the
Pentagon	arrived,	Morgan	made	himself	clear	as	cut	glass,	“[Marcus]	may	be
hurt	and	fucked	up,	but	he’s	alive	and	either	you	go	out	there	and	find	him,	or	I
will!”
Operation	Red	Wings	went	horribly	wrong	because	there	were	many	more	pro-
Taliban	hajjis	active	in	those	mountains	than	had	been	expected,	and	once
Marcus	and	his	team	were	discovered	by	villagers	there,	it	was	four	guys	against
a	well-armed	militia	of	somewhere	between	30–200	men	(reports	on	the	size	of
the	pro-Taliban	force	vary)."
Book 2,"Our	guys	took	RPG	and	machine	gun	fire,	and
fought	hard."
Book 2,Four	SEALs	can	put	on	a	hell	of	a	show.
Book 2,"Each	one	of	us	can	usually
do	as	much	damage	as	five	regular	troops,	and	they	made	their	presence	felt."
Book 2,"The	battle	played	out	along	a	ridgeline	above	9,000	feet	in	elevation,	where	they
had	communication	troubles."
Book 2,"When	they	finally	broke	through	and	the	situation
was	made	plain	to	their	commanding	officer	back	at	special	operations
headquarters,	a	quick	reaction	force	of	Navy	SEALs,	marines,	and	aviators	from
160th	Special	Operations	Aviation	Regiment	was	assembled,	but	they	were
delayed	for	hours	because	of	lack	of	transport	capacity."
Book 2,"One	thing	about	the
SEAL	teams	is	we	don’t	have	our	own	transport."
Book 2,"In	Afghanistan	we	hitch	rides
with	the	Army,	and	that	delayed	relief.They	eventually	loaded	up	into	two	Chinook	transport	choppers	and	four	attack
helicopters	(two	Black	Hawks	and	two	Apaches)	and	took	off	for	Sawtalo	Sar."
Book 2,"The	Chinooks	took	the	lead,	and	as	they	closed	in	on	the	ridge,	they	were	hit	by
small	arms	fire."
Book 2,"Despite	the	onslaught,	the	first	Chinook	hovered,	attempting	to
unload	eight	Navy	SEALs	on	a	mountain	top,	but	they	made	a	fat	target,	lingered
too	long,	and	were	hit	with	a	rocket	propelled	grenade."
Book 2,"The	bird	spun,	crashed
into	the	mountain,	and	exploded."
Book 2,Everyone	aboard	was	killed.
Book 2,"The	remaining
choppers	bailed	out,	and	by	the	time	they	could	return	with	ground	assets,
everyone	who	was	left	behind,	including	Marcus’	three	teammates	on	Operation
Red	Wings,	was	found	dead."
Book 2,"Everyone,	that	is,	except	for	Marcus."
Book 2,Marcus	was	hit	multiple	times	by	enemy	fire	and	went	missing	for	five	days.
Book 2,"He
was	saved	by	Afghan	villagers	who	nursed	and	sheltered	him,	and	was	finally
found	alive	by	U.S.	troops	on	July	3,	2005,	when	he	became	the	lone	survivor	of
a	mission	that	took	the	lives	of	nineteen	special	operations	warriors,	including
eleven	Navy	SEALs.
No	doubt,	you’ve	heard	this	story	before."
Book 2,"Marcus	wrote	a	bestselling	book	about
it,	Lone	Survivor,	which	became	a	hit	movie	starring	Mark	Wahlberg."
Book 2,"But	in
2005,	that	was	all	years	away,	and	in	the	aftermath	of	the	worst	battlefield	loss
ever	to	hit	the	SEALs,	I	was	looking	for	a	way	to	contribute	to	the	families	of	the
men	who	were	killed."
Book 2,It’s	not	like	bills	stop	rolling	in	after	a	tragedy	like	that.
Book 2,"There	were	wives	and	kids	out	there	with	basic	needs	to	fulfill,	and	eventually
they’d	need	their	college	educations	covered	too."
Book 2,"I	wanted	to	help	in	any	way	I
could."
Book 2,"A	few	weeks	before	all	of	this,	I’d	spent	an	evening	Googling	around	for	the
world’s	toughest	foot	races	and	landed	on	a	race	called	Badwater	135."
Book 2,"I’d	never
even	heard	of	ultra	marathons	before,	and	Badwater	was	an	ultra	marathoner’s
ultra	marathon."
Book 2,"It	started	below	sea	level	in	Death	Valley	and	finished	at	the	end
of	the	road	at	Mount	Whitney	Portal,	a	trailhead	located	at	8,374	feet."
Book 2,"Oh,	and
the	race	takes	place	in	late	July,	when	Death	Valley	isn’t	just	the	lowest	place	on
Earth."
Book 2,It’s	also	the	hottest.
Book 2,"Seeing	images	from	that	race	materialize	on	my	monitor	terrified	and	thrilled
me."
Book 2,"The	terrain	looked	all	kinds	of	harsh,	and	the	expressions	on	tortured
runners’	faces	reminded	me	of	the	kind	of	thing	I	saw	in	Hell	Week."
Book 2,"Until	then,
I’d	always	considered	the	marathon	to	be	the	pinnacle	of	endurance	racing,	andnow	I	was	seeing	there	were	several	levels	beyond	it."
Book 2,"I	filed	the	information
away	and	figured	I’d	come	back	to	it	someday."
Book 2,"Then	Operation	Red	Wings	happened,	and	I	vowed	to	run	Badwater	135	to	raise
money	for	the	Special	Operations	Warrior	Foundation,	a	non-profit	founded	as	a
battlefield	promise	in	1980,	when	eight	special	operations	warriors	died	in	a
helicopter	crash	during	the	famous	hostage	rescue	operation	in	Iran	and	left
seventeen	children	behind."
Book 2,"The	surviving	servicemen	promised	to	make	sure
each	one	of	those	kids	had	the	money	to	go	to	college."
Book 2,Their	work	continues.
Book 2,"Within	thirty	days	of	a	fatality,	like	those	that	occurred	during	Operation	Red
Wings,	the	foundation’s	hardworking	staff	reach	out	to	surviving	family
members."
Book 2,"“We	are	the	interfering	aunt,”	said	Executive	Director	Edie	Rosenthal."
Book 2,"“We
become	a	part	of	our	students’	lives.”
They	pay	for	preschool	and	private	tutoring	during	grade	school."
Book 2,"They	arrange
college	visits	and	host	peer	support	groups."
Book 2,"They	help	with	applications,	buy
books,	laptop	computers,	and	printers,	and	cover	tuition	at	whichever	school	one
of	their	students	manages	to	gain	acceptance,	not	to	mention	room	and	board."
Book 2,They	also	send	students	to	vocational	schools.
Book 2,It’s	all	up	to	the	kids.
Book 2,"As	I	write
this,	the	foundation	has	1,280	kids	in	their	program."
Book 2,"They	are	an	amazing	organization,	and	with	them	in	mind,	I	called	Chris
Kostman,	Race	Director	of	Badwater	135,	at	7	a.m.	in	mid-November,	2005."
Book 2,"I
tried	to	introduce	myself,	but	he	cut	me	off,	sharp."
Book 2,"“Do	you	know	what	time	it
is?!”	he	snapped."
Book 2,I	took	the	phone	away	from	my	ear	and	stared	at	it	for	a	second.
Book 2,"In	those	days,
by	7	a.m.	on	a	typical	weekday	I’d	have	already	rocked	a	two-hour	gym	workout
and	was	ready	for	a	day’s	work."
Book 2,This	dude	was	half	asleep.
Book 2,"“Roger	that,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“I’ll	call	you	back	at	0900.”
My	second	call	didn’t	go	much	better,	but	at	least	he	knew	who	I	was."
Book 2,"SBG	and
I	had	already	discussed	Badwater	and	he’d	emailed	Kostman	a	letter	of
recommendation."
Book 2,"SBG	has	raced	triathlons,	captained	a	team	through	the	Eco-
Challenge,	and	watched	several	Olympic	qualifiers	attempt	BUD/S."
Book 2,"In	his	email
to	Kostman,	he	wrote	that	I	was	the	“best	endurance	athlete	with	the	greatestmental	toughness”	he’d	ever	seen."
Book 2,"To	put	me,	a	kid	who	came	from	nothing,	at
the	top	of	his	list	meant	the	world	to	me	and	still	does."
Book 2,It	didn’t	mean	shit	to	Chris	Kostman.
Book 2,He	was	the	definition	of	unimpressed.
Book 2,"The
kind	of	unimpressed	that	can	only	come	from	real-world	experience."
Book 2,"When	he
was	twenty	years	old	he’d	competed	in	the	Race	Across	America	bicycle	race,
and	before	taking	over	as	Badwater	race	director,	he’d	run	three	100-mile	races
in	winter	in	Alaska	and	completed	a	triple	Ironman	triathlon,	which	ends	with	a
seventy-eight-mile	run."
Book 2,"Along	the	way,	he’d	seen	dozens	of	supposedly	great
athletes	crumble	beneath	the	anvil	of	ultra."
Book 2,"Weekend	warriors	sign	up	for	and	complete	marathons	after	a	few	months’
training	all	the	time,	but	the	gap	between	marathon	running	and	becoming	an
ultra	athlete	is	much	wider,	and	Badwater	was	the	absolute	apex	of	the	ultra
universe."
Book 2,"In	2005,	there	were	approximately	twenty-two	100-mile	races	held	in
the	United	States,	and	none	had	the	combination	of	the	elevation	gain	and
unforgiving	heat	that	Badwater	135	brought	to	the	table."
Book 2,"Just	to	put	on	the	race,
Kostman	had	to	wrangle	permissions	and	assistance	from	five	government
agencies,	including	the	National	Forest	Service,	the	National	Park	Service,	and
the	California	Highway	Patrol,	and	he	knew	that	if	he	allowed	some	greenhorn
into	the	most	difficult	race	ever	conceived,	in	the	middle	of	summer,	that
motherfucker	might	die,	and	his	race	would	vaporize	overnight."
Book 2,"No,	if	he	was
going	to	let	me	compete	in	Badwater,	I	was	going	to	have	to	earn	it."
Book 2,"Because
earning	my	way	in	would	provide	him	at	least	some	comfort	that	I	probably
wouldn’t	collapse	into	a	steaming	pile	of	road	kill	somewhere	between	Death
Valley	and	Mount	Whitney."
Book 2,"In	his	email,	SBG	attempted	to	make	a	case	that	because	I	was	busy	working	as
a	SEAL,	the	prerequisites	required	to	compete	at	Badwater—the	completion	of
at	least	one	100-mile	race	or	one	twenty-four-hour	race,	while	covering	at	least
one	hundred	miles—should	be	waived."
Book 2,"If	I	was	allowed	in,	SBG	guaranteed	him
that	I’d	finish	in	the	top	ten."
Book 2,Kostman	wasn’t	having	any	of	it.
Book 2,"He’d	had
accomplished	athletes	beg	him	to	waive	his	standards	over	the	years,	including	a
champion	marathoner	and	a	champion	sumo	wrestler	(yeah,	no	shit),	and	he’d
never	budged."
Book 2,"“One	thing	about	me	is,	I’m	the	same	with	everyone,”	Kostman	said	when	I
called	him	back."
Book 2,"“We	have	certain	standards	for	getting	into	our	race,	and	that’sthe	way	it	is."
Book 2,"But	hey,	there’s	this	twenty-four-hour	race	in	San	Diego	coming	up
this	weekend,”	he	continued,	his	voice	dripping	with	sarcasm."
Book 2,"“Go	run	one
hundred	miles	and	get	back	to	me.”
Chris	Kostman	had	made	me."
Book 2,I	was	as	unprepared	as	he	suspected.
Book 2,"The	fact	that
I	wanted	to	run	Badwater	was	no	lie,	and	I	planned	to	train	for	it,	but	to	even
have	a	chance	to	do	that	I’d	have	to	run	one	hundred	miles	at	the	drop	of	a	damn
hat."
Book 2,"If	I	chose	not	to,	after	all	that	Navy	SEAL	bluster,	what	would	that	prove?"
Book 2,"That	I	was	just	another	pretender	ringing	his	bell	way	too	early	on	a	Wednesday
morning."
Book 2,"Which	is	how	and	why	I	wound	up	running	the	San	Diego	One	Day
with	three	days’	notice."
Book 2,"***
After	surpassing	the	fifty-mile	mark,	I	could	no	longer	keep	up	with	Ms.	Inagaki,
who	bounded	ahead	like	a	damn	rabbit."
Book 2,I	soldiered	on	in	a	fugue	state.
Book 2,"Pain
washed	through	me	in	waves."
Book 2,My	thighs	felt	like	they	were	loaded	with	lead.
Book 2,The	heavier	they	got	the	more	twisted	my	stride	became.
Book 2,"I	torqued	my	hips	to
keep	my	legs	moving	and	fought	gravity	to	lift	my	feet	a	mere	millimeter	from
the	earth."
Book 2,"Ah,	yes,	my	feet."
Book 2,"My	bones	were	becoming	more	brittle	by	the	second,
and	my	toes	had	banged	the	tips	of	my	shoes	for	nearly	ten	hours."
Book 2,"Still,	I	fucking
ran."
Book 2,Not	fast.
Book 2,Not	with	much	style.
Book 2,But	I	kept	going.
Book 2,My	shins	were	the	next	domino	to	fall.
Book 2,"Each	subtle	rotation	of	the	ankle	joint	felt
like	shock	therapy—like	venom	flowing	through	the	marrow	of	my	tibia."
Book 2,"It
brought	back	memories	of	my	duct	tape	days	from	Class	235,	but	I	didn’t	bring
any	tape	with	me	this	time."
Book 2,"Besides,	if	I	stopped	for	even	a	few	seconds,	starting
up	again	would	be	near	impossible."
Book 2,"A	few	miles	later,	my	lungs	seized,	and	my	chest	rattled	as	I	hocked	up	knots	of
brown	mucus."
Book 2,It	got	cold.
Book 2,I	became	short	of	breath.
Book 2,"Fog	gathered	around	the
halogen	street	lights,	ringing	the	lamps	with	electric	rainbows,	which	lent	the
whole	event	an	otherworldly	feel."
Book 2,Or	maybe	it	was	just	me	in	that	other	world.
Book 2,"One	in	which	pain	was	the	mother	tongue,	a	language	synced	to	memory."
Book 2,With	every	lung-scraping	cough	I	flashed	to	my	first	BUD/S	class.
Book 2,"I	was	back	on
the	motherfucking	log,	staggering	ahead,	my	lungs	bleeding."
Book 2,"I	could	feel	and	see
it	happening	all	over	again."
Book 2,Was	I	asleep?
Book 2,Was	I	dreaming?
Book 2,"I	opened	my	eyeswide,	pulled	my	ears	and	slapped	my	face	to	wake	up."
Book 2,"I	felt	my	lips	and	chin	for
fresh	blood,	and	found	a	translucent	slick	of	saliva,	sweat,	and	mucus	dribbling
from	my	nose."
Book 2,"SBG’s	hard-ass	nerds	were	all	around	me	now,	running	in	circles,
pointing,	mocking	the	only;	the	only	black	man	in	the	mix."
Book 2,Or	were	they?
Book 2,"I	took
another	look."
Book 2,Everyone	who	passed	me	was	focused.
Book 2,"Each	in	their	own	pain
zone."
Book 2,They	didn’t	even	see	me.
Book 2,"I	was	losing	touch	with	reality	in	small	doses,	because	my	mind	was	folding
over	on	itself,	loading	tremendous	physical	pain	with	dark	emotional	garbage	it
had	dredged	up	from	the	depths	of	my	soul."
Book 2,"Translation:	I	was	suffering	on	an
unholy	level	reserved	for	dumb	fucks	who	thought	the	laws	of	physics	and
physiology	did	not	apply	to	them."
Book 2,"Cocky	bastards	like	me	who	felt	like	they
could	push	the	limits	safely	because	they’d	done	a	couple	of	Hell	Weeks."
Book 2,"Right,	well,	I	hadn’t	done	this."
Book 2,I	hadn’t	run	one	hundred	miles	with	zero	training.
Book 2,"Had	anybody	in	the	history	of	mankind	even	attempted	something	so	fucking
foolish?"
Book 2,Could	this	even	be	done	at	all?
Book 2,"Iterations	of	that	one	simple	question
slid	by	like	a	digital	ticker	on	my	brain	screen."
Book 2,"Bloody	thought	bubbles	floated
from	my	skin	and	soul."
Book 2,Why?
Book 2,Why?
Book 2,"Why	the	fuck	are	you	still	doing	this	to	yourself?!
I	hit	the	incline	at	mile	sixty-nine—that	seven-foot	ramp,	the	pitch	of	a	shallow
driveway—which	would	make	any	seasoned	trail	runner	laugh	out	loud."
Book 2,"It
buckled	my	knees	and	sent	me	reeling	backward	like	a	delivery	truck	in	neutral."
Book 2,"I	staggered,	reached	for	the	ground	with	the	tips	of	my	fingers,	and	nearly
capsized."
Book 2,It	took	ten	seconds	to	cover	the	distance.
Book 2,"Each	one	dragged	out	like	an
elastic	thread,	sending	shockwaves	of	pain	from	my	toes	to	the	space	behind	my
eyeballs."
Book 2,"I	hacked	and	coughed,	my	gut	twisted."
Book 2,Collapse	was	imminent.
Book 2,Collapse	is	what	the	fuck	I	deserved.
Book 2,At	the	seventy-mile	mark	I	couldn’t	take	another	step	forward.
Book 2,"Kate	had	set	up
our	lawn	chair	on	the	grass	near	the	start/finish	line	and	when	I	teetered	toward
her	I	saw	her	in	triplicate,	six	hands	groping	toward	me,	guiding	me	into	that
folding	chair."
Book 2,"I	was	dizzy	and	dehydrated,	starved	of	potassium	and	sodium."
Book 2,"Kate	was	a	nurse;	I	had	EMT	training,	and	went	through	my	own	mental
checklist."
Book 2,I	knew	my	blood	pressure	was	probably	dangerously	low.
Book 2,Sheremoved	my	shoes.
Book 2,My	foot	pain	was	no	Shawn	Dobbs	illusion.
Book 2,"My	white	tube
socks	were	caked	in	blood	from	cracked	toenails	and	broken	blisters."
Book 2,"I	asked
Kate	to	grab	some	Motrin	and	anything	she	thought	might	be	helpful	from	John
Metz."
Book 2,"And	when	she	was	gone,	my	body	continued	to	decline."
Book 2,"My	stomach
rumbled	and	when	I	looked	down	I	saw	bloody	piss	leak	down	my	leg."
Book 2,"I	shit
myself	too."
Book 2,"Liquefied	diarrhea	rose	in	the	space	between	my	ass	and	a	lawn	chair
that	would	never	be	quite	the	same	again."
Book 2,"Worse,	I	had	to	hide	it	because	I	knew
if	Kate	saw	how	bad	off	I	really	was	she	would	beg	me	to	pull	out	of	the	race."
Book 2,"I’d	run	seventy	miles	in	twelve	hours	with	no	training,	and	this	was	my	reward."
Book 2,To	my	left	on	the	lawn	was	another	four-pack	of	Myoplex.
Book 2,"Only	a	muscle	head
like	me	would	choose	that	thick-ass	protein	drink	as	my	hydrating	agent	of
choice."
Book 2,"Next	to	it	was	half	a	box	of	Ritz	crackers,	the	other	half	now	congealing
and	churning	in	my	stomach	and	intestinal	tract	like	an	orange	blob."
Book 2,I	sat	there	with	my	head	in	my	hands	for	twenty	minutes.
Book 2,"Runners	shuffled,
glided,	or	staggered	past	me,	as	I	felt	time	tick	down	on	my	hastily	imagined,	ill-
conceived	dream."
Book 2,"Kate	returned,	knelt	down,	and	helped	me	lace	back	up."
Book 2,"She
didn’t	know	the	extent	of	my	breakdown	and	hadn’t	quit	on	me	yet."
Book 2,"That	was
something,	at	least,	and	in	her	hands	were	a	welcome	reprieve	from	more
Myoplex	and	more	Ritz	crackers."
Book 2,"She	handed	me	Motrin,	then	some	cookies	and
two	peanut	butter	and	jelly	sandwiches,	which	I	washed	down	with	Gatorade."
Book 2,Then	she	helped	me	stand.
Book 2,The	world	wobbled	on	its	axis.
Book 2,"Again	she	split	into	two,	then	three,	but	she	held
me	there	as	my	world	stabilized	and	I	took	a	single,	solitary	step."
Book 2,"Cue	the
ungodly	pain."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	it	yet,	but	my	feet	were	slivered	with	stress
fractures."
Book 2,"The	toll	of	hubris	is	heavy	on	the	ultra	circuit,	and	my	bill	had	come
due."
Book 2,I	took	another	step.
Book 2,And	another.
Book 2,I	winced.
Book 2,My	eyes	watered.
Book 2,Another	step.
Book 2,She	let	go.
Book 2,I	walked	on.
Book 2,Slowly.
Book 2,Way	too	fucking	slow.
Book 2,"When	I	stopped	at	the	seventy-mile	mark,	I	was	well	ahead	of	the	pace	I	needed
to	run	one	hundred	miles	in	twenty	four	hours,	but	now	I	was	walking	at	a
twenty-minute-a-mile	clip,	which	was	as	fast	as	I	could	possibly	move."
Book 2,Ms.Inagaki	breezed	by	me	and	glanced	over.
Book 2,"There	was	pain	in	her	eyes	too,	but	she
still	looked	the	part	of	an	athlete."
Book 2,"I	was	a	motherfucking	zombie,	giving	away	all
the	precious	time	I	stored	up,	watching	my	margin	for	error	burn	to	ash."
Book 2,Why?
Book 2,Again	the	same	boring	question.
Book 2,Why?
Book 2,"Four	hours	later,	at	nearly	2	a.m.,	I	hit	the
eighty-one-mile	mark	and	Kate	broke	some	news."
Book 2,"“I	don’t	believe	you’re	gonna	make	the	time	at	this	pace,”	she	said,	walking	with
me,	encouraging	me	to	drink	more	Myoplex."
Book 2,She	didn’t	cushion	the	blow.
Book 2,"She
was	matter-of-fact	about	it."
Book 2,"I	stared	over	at	her,	mucus	and	Myoplex	dripping
down	my	chin,	all	the	life	drained	from	my	eyes."
Book 2,"For	four	hours,	each	agonizing
step	had	demanded	maximum	focus	and	effort,	but	it	wasn’t	enough	and	unless	I
could	find	more,	my	philanthropic	dream	was	dead."
Book 2,I	choked	and	coughed.
Book 2,"Took
another	sip."
Book 2,"“Roger	that,”	I	said	softly."
Book 2,I	knew	that	she	was	right.
Book 2,"My	pace	continued	to	slow
and	was	only	getting	worse."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	finally	realized	that	this	fight	wasn’t	about	Operation	Red	Wings
or	the	families	of	the	fallen."
Book 2,"It	was	to	a	point,	but	none	of	that	would	help	me	run
nineteen	more	miles	before	10	a.m.	No,	this	run,	Badwater,	my	entire	desire	to
push	myself	to	the	brink	of	destruction,	was	about	me."
Book 2,"It	was	about	how	much	I
was	willing	to	suffer,	how	much	more	I	could	take,	and	how	much	I	had	to	give."
Book 2,"If	I	was	gonna	make	it,	this	shit	would	have	to	get	personal."
Book 2,I	stared	down	at	my	legs.
Book 2,"I	could	still	see	a	trail	of	dried	piss	and	blood	stuck	to
my	inner	thigh	and	thought	to	myself,	who	in	this	entire	fucked-up	world	would
still	be	in	this	fight?"
Book 2,"Only	you,	Goggins!	You	haven’t	trained,	you	don’t	know
dick	about	hydration	and	performance—all	you	know	is	you	refuse	to	quit."
Book 2,Why?
Book 2,"It’s	funny,	humans	tend	to	hatch	our	most	challenging	goals	and	dreams,	the
ones	that	demand	our	greatest	effort	yet	promise	absolutely	nothing,	when	we
are	tucked	into	our	comfort	zones."
Book 2,"I	was	at	work	when	Kostman	laid	out	his
challenge	for	me."
Book 2,I’d	just	had	a	warm	shower.
Book 2,I	was	fed	and	watered.
Book 2,"I	was
comfortable."
Book 2,"And	looking	back,	every	single	time	I’ve	been	inspired	to	do
something	difficult,	I	was	in	a	soft	environment,	because	it	all	sounds	doable
when	you’re	chilling	on	your	fucking	couch,	with	a	glass	of	lemonade	or	achocolate	shake	in	your	hand."
Book 2,"When	we’re	comfortable	we	can’t	answer	those
simple	questions	that	are	bound	to	arise	in	the	heat	of	battle	because	we	don’t
even	realize	they’re	coming."
Book 2,"But	those	answers	are	very	important	when	you	are	no	longer	in	your	air-
conditioned	room	or	under	your	fluffy	blanket."
Book 2,"When	your	body	is	broken	and
beaten,	when	you’re	confronted	with	agonizing	pain	and	staring	into	the
unknown,	your	mind	will	spin,	and	that’s	when	those	questions	become	toxic."
Book 2,"If
you	aren’t	prepared	in	advance,	if	you	allow	your	mind	to	remain	undisciplined
in	an	environment	of	intense	suffering	(it	won’t	feel	like	it,	but	it	is	very	much	a
choice	you	are	making),	the	only	answer	you	are	likely	to	find	is	the	one	that
will	make	it	stop	as	fast	as	possible."
Book 2,I	don’t	know.
Book 2,Hell	Week	changed	everything	for	me.
Book 2,"It	allowed	me	to	have	the	mindset	to	sign
up	for	that	twenty-four-hour	race	with	less	than	a	week’s	notice	because	during
Hell	Week	you	live	all	the	emotions	of	life,	all	the	highs	and	lows,	in	six	days."
Book 2,"In
130	hours,	you	earn	decades	of	wisdom."
Book 2,"That’s	why	there	was	a	schism	between
the	twins	after	Marcus	went	through	BUD/S."
Book 2,"He’d	gained	the	kind	of	self-
knowledge	that	can	only	come	from	being	broken	down	to	nothing	and	finding
more	within."
Book 2,"Morgan	couldn’t	speak	that	language	until	he	endured	it	for
himself."
Book 2,"After	surviving	two	Hell	Weeks	and	participating	in	three,	I	was	a	native
speaker."
Book 2,Hell	Week	was	home.
Book 2,"It	was	the	fairest	place	I’ve	ever	been	in	this
world."
Book 2,There	were	no	timed	evolutions.
Book 2,"There	was	nothing	graded,	and	there
were	no	trophies."
Book 2,"It	was	an	all-out	war	of	me	against	me,	and	that’s	exactly
where	I	found	myself	again	when	I	was	reduced	to	my	absolute	lowest	on
Hospitality	Point."
Book 2,"Why?!	Why	are	you	still	doing	this	to	yourself,	Goggins?!
“Because	you	are	one	hard	motherfucker,”	I	screamed."
Book 2,"The	voices	in	my	head	were	so	penetrating,	I	had	to	bite	back	out	loud."
Book 2,"I	was
onto	something."
Book 2,"I	felt	an	energy	build	immediately,	as	I	realized	that	still	being
in	the	fight	was	a	miracle	in	itself."
Book 2,Except	it	wasn’t	a	miracle.
Book 2,God	didn’t	comedown	and	bless	my	ass.
Book 2,"I	did	this!	I	kept	going	when	I	should	have	quit	five
hours	ago."
Book 2,I	am	the	reason	I	still	have	a	chance.
Book 2,"And	I	remembered	something
else	too."
Book 2,This	wasn’t	the	first	time	I’d	taken	on	a	seemingly	impossible	task.
Book 2,"I
picked	up	my	pace."
Book 2,"I	was	still	walking,	but	I	wasn’t	sleepwalking	anymore."
Book 2,"I	had
life!	I	kept	digging	into	my	past,	into	my	own	imaginary	Cookie	Jar."
Book 2,"I	remembered	as	a	kid,	no	matter	how	fucked	up	our	life	was,	my	mother	always
figured	out	a	way	to	stock	our	damn	cookie	jar."
Book 2,"She’d	buy	wafers	and	Oreos,
Pepperidge	Farm	Milanos	and	Chips	Ahoy!,	and	whenever	she	showed	up	with	a
new	batch	of	cookies,	she	dumped	them	into	one	jar."
Book 2,"With	her	permission	we’d
get	to	pick	one	or	two	out	at	a	time."
Book 2,It	was	like	a	mini	treasure	hunt.
Book 2,"I	remember
the	joy	of	dropping	my	fist	into	that	jar,	wondering	what	I’d	find,	and	before	I
crammed	the	cookie	in	my	mouth	I	always	took	the	time	to	admire	it	first,
especially	when	we	were	broke	in	Brazil."
Book 2,"I’d	turn	it	around	in	my	hand	and	say
my	own	little	prayer	of	thanks."
Book 2,"The	feeling	of	being	that	kid,	locked	in	a	moment
of	gratitude	for	a	simple	gift	like	a	cookie,	came	back	to	me."
Book 2,"I	felt	it	viscerally,
and	I	used	that	concept	to	stuff	a	new	kind	of	Cookie	Jar."
Book 2,"Inside	it	were	all	my
past	victories."
Book 2,"Like	the	time	when	I	had	to	study	three	times	as	hard	as	anybody	else	during	my
senior	year	in	high	school	just	to	graduate."
Book 2,That	was	a	cookie.
Book 2,"Or	when	I	passed
the	ASVAB	test	as	a	senior	and	then	again	to	get	into	BUD/S."
Book 2,"Two	more
cookies."
Book 2,"I	remembered	dropping	over	a	hundred	pounds	in	under	three	months,
conquering	my	fear	of	water,	graduating	BUD/S	at	the	top	of	my	class,	and
being	named	Enlisted	Honor	Man	in	Army	Ranger	School	(more	on	that	soon)."
Book 2,All	those	were	cookies	loaded	with	chocolate	chunks.
Book 2,These	weren’t	mere	flashbacks.
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	just	floating	through	my	memory	files,	I
actually	tapped	into	the	emotional	state	I	felt	during	those	victories,	and	in	so
doing	accessed	my	sympathetic	nervous	system	once	again."
Book 2,"My	adrenaline	took
over,	the	pain	started	to	fade	just	enough,	and	my	pace	picked	up."
Book 2,"I	began
swinging	my	arms	and	lengthening	my	stride."
Book 2,"My	fractured	feet	were	still	a
bloody	mess,	full	of	blisters,	the	toenails	peeling	off	almost	every	toe,	but	I	kept
pounding,	and	soon	it	was	me	who	was	slaloming	runners	with	pained
expressions	as	I	raced	the	clock."
Book 2,"From	then	on,	the	Cookie	Jar	became	a	concept	I’ve	employed	whenever	I	need
a	reminder	of	who	I	am	and	what	I’m	capable	of."
Book 2,"We	all	have	a	cookie	jar	insideus,	because	life,	being	what	it	is,	has	always	tested	us."
Book 2,"Even	if	you’re	feeling	low
and	beat	down	by	life	right	now,	I	guarantee	you	can	think	of	a	time	or	two	when
you	overcame	odds	and	tasted	success."
Book 2,It	doesn’t	have	to	be	a	big	victory	either.
Book 2,It	can	be	something	small.
Book 2,"I	know	we	all	want	the	whole	victory	today,	but	when	I	was	teaching	myself	to
read	I	would	be	happy	when	I	could	understand	every	word	in	a	single
paragraph."
Book 2,"I	knew	I	still	had	a	long	way	to	go	to	move	from	a	third-grade
reading	level	to	that	of	a	senior	in	high	school,	but	even	a	small	win	like	that	was
enough	to	keep	me	interested	in	learning	and	finding	more	within	myself."
Book 2,"You
don’t	drop	one	hundred	pounds	in	less	than	three	months	without	losing	five
pounds	in	a	week	first."
Book 2,"Those	first	five	pounds	I	lost	were	a	small
accomplishment,	and	it	doesn’t	sound	like	a	lot,	but	at	the	time	it	was	proof	that	I
could	lose	weight	and	that	my	goal,	however	improbable,	was	not	impossible!
The	engine	in	a	rocket	ship	does	not	fire	without	a	small	spark	first."
Book 2,"We	all	need
small	sparks,	small	accomplishments	in	our	lives	to	fuel	the	big	ones."
Book 2,"Think	of
your	small	accomplishments	as	kindling."
Book 2,"When	you	want	a	bonfire,	you	don’t
start	by	lighting	a	big	log."
Book 2,"You	collect	some	witch’s	hair—a	small	pile	of	hay	or
some	dry,	dead	grass."
Book 2,"You	light	that,	and	then	add	small	sticks	and	bigger	sticks
before	you	feed	your	tree	stump	into	the	blaze."
Book 2,"Because	it’s	the	small	sparks,
which	start	small	fires,	that	eventually	build	enough	heat	to	burn	the	whole
fucking	forest	down."
Book 2,"If	you	don’t	have	any	big	accomplishments	to	draw	on	yet,	so	be	it."
Book 2,"Your	small
victories	are	your	cookies	to	savor,	and	make	sure	you	do	savor	them."
Book 2,"Yeah,	I
was	hard	on	myself	when	I	looked	in	the	Accountability	Mirror,	but	I	also
praised	myself	whenever	I	could	claim	a	small	victory,	because	we	all	need	that,
and	very	few	of	us	take	the	time	to	celebrate	our	successes."
Book 2,"Sure,	in	the	moment,
we	might	enjoy	them,	but	do	we	ever	look	back	on	them	and	feel	that	win	again
and	again?"
Book 2,Maybe	that	sounds	narcissistic	to	you.
Book 2,"But	I’m	not	talking	about
bullshitting	about	the	glory	days	here."
Book 2,"I’m	not	suggesting	you	crawl	up	your	own
ass	and	bore	your	friends	with	all	your	stories	about	what	a	badass	you	used	to
be."
Book 2,Nobody	wants	to	hear	that	shit.
Book 2,"I’m	talking	about	utilizing	past	successes	to
fuel	you	to	new	and	bigger	ones."
Book 2,"Because	in	the	heat	of	battle,	when	shit	gets
real,	we	need	to	draw	inspiration	to	push	through	our	own	exhaustion,
depression,	pain,	and	misery."
Book 2,"We	need	to	spark	a	bunch	of	small	fires	to	become
the	motherfucking	inferno.But	digging	into	the	Cookie	Jar	when	things	are	going	south	takes	focus	and
determination	because	at	first	the	brain	doesn’t	want	to	go	there."
Book 2,"It	wants	to
remind	you	that	you’re	suffering	and	that	your	goal	is	impossible."
Book 2,"It	wants	to
stop	you	so	it	can	stop	the	pain."
Book 2,"That	night	in	San	Diego	was	the	most	difficult
night	of	my	life,	physically."
Book 2,"I’d	never	felt	so	broken,	and	there	were	no	souls	to
take."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	competing	for	a	trophy.
Book 2,There	was	no	one	standing	in	my	way.
Book 2,"All
I	had	to	draw	on	to	keep	myself	going	was	me."
Book 2,The	Cookie	Jar	became	my	energy	bank.
Book 2,"Whenever	the	pain	got	to	be	too	much,
I	dug	into	it	and	took	a	bite."
Book 2,"The	pain	was	never	gone,	but	I	only	felt	it	in	waves
because	my	brain	was	otherwise	occupied,	which	allowed	me	to	drown	out	the
simple	questions	and	shrink	time."
Book 2,"Each	lap	became	a	victory	lap,	celebrating	a
different	cookie,	another	small	fire."
Book 2,"Mile	eighty-one	became	eighty-two,	and	an
hour	and	a	half	later,	I	was	in	the	nineties."
Book 2,"I’d	run	ninety	fucking	miles	with	no
training!	Who	does	that	shit?"
Book 2,"An	hour	later	I	was	at	ninety-five,	and	after	nearly
nineteen	hours	of	running	almost	non-stop,	I’d	done	it!	I’d	hit	one	hundred
miles!	Or	had	I?"
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	remember,	so	I	ran	one	more	lap	just	to	make	sure."
Book 2,"After	running	101	miles,	my	race	finally	over,	I	staggered	to	my	lawn	chair	and
Kate	placed	a	camouflaged	poncho	liner	over	my	body	as	I	shivered	in	the	fog."
Book 2,Steam	poured	off	me.
Book 2,My	vision	was	blurred.
Book 2,"I	remember	feeling	something
warm	on	my	leg,	looked	down	and	saw	I	was	pissing	blood	again."
Book 2,"I	knew	what
was	coming	next,	but	the	port-a-potties	were	about	forty	feet	away,	which	may
as	well	have	been	forty	miles,	or	4,000."
Book 2,"I	tried	to	get	up	but	I	was	way	too	dizzy
and	collapsed	back	into	that	chair,	an	immovable	object	ready	to	accept	the
inevitable	truth	that	I	was	about	to	shit	myself."
Book 2,It	was	much	worse	this	time.
Book 2,"My
entire	backside	and	lower	back	were	smeared	with	warm	feces."
Book 2,Kate	knew	what	an	emergency	looked	like.
Book 2,"She	sprinted	to	our	Toyota	Camry
and	backed	the	car	up	on	the	grassy	knoll	beside	me."
Book 2,"My	legs	were	stiff	as
fossils	frozen	in	stone,	and	I	leaned	on	her	to	slide	into	the	backseat."
Book 2,"She	was
frantic	behind	the	wheel	and	wanted	to	take	me	directly	to	the	ER,	but	I	wanted
to	go	home."
Book 2,"We	lived	on	the	second	deck	of	an	apartment	complex	in	Chula	Vista,	and	I
leaned	on	her	back	with	my	arms	around	her	neck	as	she	led	me	up	that
staircase."
Book 2,She	balanced	me	up	against	the	stucco	as	she	opened	the	door	to	ourapartment.
Book 2,I	took	a	few	steps	inside	before	blacking	out.
Book 2,"I	came	to,	on	the	kitchen	floor,	a	few	minutes	later."
Book 2,"My	back	was	still	smeared
with	shit,	my	thighs	caked	in	blood	and	urine."
Book 2,"My	feet	were	blistered	up	and
bleeding	in	twelve	places."
Book 2,"Seven	of	my	ten	toenails	were	dangling	loose,
connected	only	by	tabs	of	dead	skin."
Book 2,"We	had	a	combination	tub	and	shower	and
she	got	the	shower	going	before	helping	me	crawl	toward	the	bathroom	and
climb	into	the	tub."
Book 2,"I	remember	lying	there,	naked,	with	the	shower	pouring	down
upon	me."
Book 2,"I	shivered,	felt	and	looked	like	death,	and	then	I	started	peeing	again."
Book 2,"But	instead	of	blood	or	urine,	what	came	out	of	me	looked	like	thick	brown	bile."
Book 2,"Petrified,	Kate	stepped	into	the	hall	to	dial	my	mom."
Book 2,"She’d	been	to	the	race	with
a	friend	of	hers	who	happened	to	be	a	doctor."
Book 2,"When	he	heard	my	symptoms,	the
doctor	suggested	that	I	might	be	in	kidney	failure	and	that	I	needed	to	go	to	the
ER	immediately."
Book 2,"Kate	hung	up,	stormed	into	the	bathroom,	and	found	me	lying
on	my	left	side,	in	the	fetal	position."
Book 2,"“We	need	to	get	you	to	the	ER	now,	David!”
She	kept	talking,	shouting,	crying,	trying	to	reach	me	through	the	haze,	and	I
heard	most	of	what	she	said,	but	I	knew	if	we	went	to	the	hospital	they’d	give
me	pain	killers	and	I	didn’t	want	to	mask	this	pain."
Book 2,"I’d	just	accomplished	the
most	amazing	feat	in	my	entire	life."
Book 2,"It	was	harder	than	Hell	Week,	more
significant	to	me	than	becoming	a	SEAL,	and	more	challenging	than	my
deployment	to	Iraq	because	this	time	I	had	done	something	I’m	not	sure	anyone
had	ever	done	before."
Book 2,I	ran	101	miles	with	zero	preparation.
Book 2,I	knew	then	that	I’d	been	selling	myself	short.
Book 2,"That	there	was	a	whole	new	level
of	performance	out	there	to	tap	into."
Book 2,"That	the	human	body	can	withstand	and
accomplish	a	hell	of	a	lot	more	than	most	of	us	think	possible,	and	that	it	all
begins	and	ends	in	the	mind."
Book 2,This	wasn’t	a	theory.
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	something	I’d	read
in	a	damn	book."
Book 2,I’d	experienced	it	first	hand	on	Hospitality	Point.
Book 2,This	last	part.
Book 2,This	pain	and	suffering.
Book 2,This	was	my	trophy	ceremony.
Book 2,"I’d	earned
this."
Book 2,"This	was	confirmation	that	I’d	mastered	my	own	mind—at	least	for	a	little
while—and	that	what	I’d	just	accomplished	was	something	special."
Book 2,"As	I	lay
there,	curled	up	in	the	tub,	shivering	in	the	fetal	position,	relishing	the	pain,	I
thought	of	something	else	too."
Book 2,"If	I	could	run	101	miles	with	zero	training,CHALLENGE	#6
Take	inventory	of	your	Cookie	Jar."
Book 2,Crack	your	journal	open	again.
Book 2,"Write	it	all
out."
Book 2,"Remember,	this	is	not	some	breezy	stroll	through	your	personal	trophy
room."
Book 2,Don’t	just	write	down	your	achievement	hit	list.
Book 2,"Include	life	obstacles
you’ve	overcome	as	well,	like	quitting	smoking	or	overcoming	depression	or	a
stutter."
Book 2,"Add	in	those	minor	tasks	you	failed	earlier	in	life,	but	tried	again	a
second	or	third	time	and	ultimately	succeeded	at."
Book 2,"Feel	what	it	was	like	to
overcome	those	struggles,	those	opponents,	and	win."
Book 2,Then	get	to	work.
Book 2,"Set	ambitious	goals	before	each	workout	and	let	those	past	victories	carry	you	to
new	personal	bests."
Book 2,"If	it’s	a	run	or	bike	ride,	include	some	time	to	do	interval
work	and	challenge	yourself	to	beat	your	best	mile	split."
Book 2,"Or	simply	maintain	a
maximum	heart	rate	for	a	full	minute,	then	two	minutes."
Book 2,"If	you’re	at	home,	focus
on	pull-ups	or	push-ups."
Book 2,Do	as	many	as	possible	in	two	minutes.
Book 2,"Then	try	to	beat
your	best."
Book 2,"When	the	pain	hits	and	tries	to	stop	you	short	of	your	goal,	dunk	your
fist	in,	pull	out	a	cookie,	and	let	it	fuel	you!
If	you’re	more	focused	on	intellectual	growth,	train	yourself	to	study	harder	and
longer	than	ever	before,	or	read	a	record	number	of	books	in	a	given	month."
Book 2,Your	Cookie	Jar	can	help	there	too.
Book 2,"Because	if	you	perform	this	challenge
correctly	and	truly	challenge	yourself,	you’ll	come	to	a	point	in	any	exercise
where	pain,	boredom,	or	self-doubt	kicks	in,	and	you’ll	need	to	push	back	to	get
through	it."
Book 2,"The	Cookie	Jar	is	your	shortcut	to	taking	control	of	your	own	thought
process."
Book 2,"Use	it	that	way!	The	point	here	isn’t	to	make	yourself	feel	like	a	hero
for	the	fuck	of	it."
Book 2,It’s	not	a	hooray-for-me	session.
Book 2,"It’s	to	remember	what	a
badass	you	are	so	you	can	use	that	energy	to	succeed	again	in	the	heat	of	battle!
Post	your	memories	and	the	new	successes	they	fueled	on	social	media,	and
include	the	hashtags:	#canthurtme	#cookiejar.CHAPTER	SEVEN
7."
Book 2,"THE	MOST	POWERFUL	WEAPON
Twenty-seven	hours	after	savoring	intense,	gratifying	pain	and	basking	in	the
afterglow	of	my	greatest	achievement	so	far,	I	was	back	at	my	desk	on	a	Monday
morning."
Book 2,"SBG	was	my	commanding	officer,	and	I	had	his	permission,	and	every
known	excuse,	to	take	a	few	days	off."
Book 2,"Instead,	swollen,	sore,	and	miserable,	I
pulled	myself	out	of	bed,	hobbled	into	work,	and	later	that	morning	called	Chris
Kostman."
Book 2,I’d	been	looking	forward	to	this.
Book 2,"I	imagined	the	sweet	note	of	surprise	in	his
voice,	after	hearing	that	I’d	taken	his	challenge	and	run	101	miles	in	less	than
twenty-four	hours."
Book 2,"Perhaps	there’d	even	be	some	overdue	respect	as	he	made	my
entry	to	Badwater	official."
Book 2,"Instead,	my	call	went	to	voicemail."
Book 2,"I	left	him	a	polite
message	he	never	returned,	and	two	days	later	I	dropped	him	an	email."
Book 2,"Sir,	how	are	you	doing?"
Book 2,"I	ran	the	one	hundred	miles	needed	to	qualify	in	18
hours	and	56	minutes…I	would	like	to	know	now	what	I	need	to	do	to	get
into	Badwater…so	we	can	begin	raising	money	for	the	[Special	Operations
Warrior]	foundation."
Book 2,"Thanks	again…
His	reply	came	in	the	next	day,	and	it	threw	me	way	the	fuck	off."
Book 2,Congrats	on	your	hundred-mile	finish.
Book 2,But	did	you	actually	stop	then?
Book 2,"The
point	of	a	twenty-four-hour	event	is	to	run	for	twenty-four	hours…
Anyway…stay	tuned	for	the	announcement	that	you	can	apply…The	race
will	be	July	24–26."
Book 2,"Best	regards,
Chris	Kostman
I	couldn’t	help	but	take	his	response	personally."
Book 2,"On	a	Wednesday	he	suggested	I
run	one	hundred	miles	in	twenty-four	hours	that	Saturday."
Book 2,"I	got	it	done	in	less
time	than	he	required,	and	he	still	wasn’t	impressed?"
Book 2,"Kostman	was	a	veteran	ofultra	races,	so	he	knew	that	strewn	behind	me	were	a	dozen	performance	barriers
and	pain	thresholds	I’d	shattered."
Book 2,"Obviously,	none	of	that	meant	much	to	him."
Book 2,"I	cooled	off	for	a	week	before	I	wrote	him	back,	and	in	the	meantime	looked	into
other	races	to	bolster	my	resume."
Book 2,"There	were	very	few	available	that	late	in	the
year."
Book 2,"I	found	a	fifty-miler	on	Catalina,	but	only	triple	digits	would	impress	a	guy
like	Kostman."
Book 2,"Plus,	it	had	been	a	full	week	since	the	San	Diego	One	Day	and	my
body	was	still	monumentally	fucked."
Book 2,"I	hadn’t	run	three	feet	since	finishing	mile
101."
Book 2,My	frustration	flashed	with	the	cursor	as	I	crafted	my	rebuttal.
Book 2,Thanks	for	emailing	me	back.
Book 2,"I	see	that	you	enjoy	talking	about	as	much	as
I	do."
Book 2,"The	only	reason	why	I’m	still	bugging	you	is	because	this	race	and	the
cause	behind	it	is	important…If	you	have	any	other	qualifying	races	that
you	think	I	should	do,	please	let	me	know…Thanks	for	letting	me	know
I’m	supposed	to	run	the	full	twenty-four	hours."
Book 2,"Next	time	I’ll	be	sure	to	do
that."
Book 2,"It	took	him	another	full	week	to	respond,	and	he	didn’t	offer	a	hell	of	a	lot	more
hope,	but	at	least	he	salted	it	with	sarcasm."
Book 2,"Hi	David,
If	you	can	do	some	more	ultras	between	now	and	Jan	3–24,	the	application
period,	great."
Book 2,"If	not,	submit	the	best	possible	application	during	the	Jan	3–
24	window	and	cross	your	fingers."
Book 2,"Thanks	for	your	enthusiasm,
Chris
At	this	point	I	was	starting	to	like	Chris	Kostman	a	lot	better	than	my	chances	of
getting	into	Badwater."
Book 2,"What	I	didn’t	know,	because	he	never	mentioned	it,	is
that	Kostman	was	one	of	five	people	on	the	Badwater	admissions	committee,
which	reviews	upwards	of	1,000	applications	a	year."
Book 2,"Each	judge	scores	every
application,	and	based	on	their	cumulative	scores,	the	top	ninety	applicants	get	in
on	merit."
Book 2,"From	the	sounds	of	it,	my	resume	was	thin	and	wouldn’t	crack	the	top
ninety."
Book 2,"On	the	other	hand,	Kostman	held	ten	wild	cards	in	his	back	pocket."
Book 2,"He
could	have	already	guaranteed	me	a	spot,	but	for	some	reason	he	kept	pushingme."
Book 2,"Once	again	I’d	have	to	prove	myself	beyond	a	minimum	standard	to	get	a
fair	shake."
Book 2,"To	become	a	SEAL,	I	had	to	deal	with	three	Hell	Weeks,	and	now,	if
I	really	wanted	to	run	Badwater	and	raise	money	for	families	in	need,	I	was
going	to	have	to	find	a	way	to	make	my	application	bulletproof."
Book 2,"Based	on	a	link	he	sent	along	with	his	reply,	I	found	one	more	ultra	race
scheduled	before	the	Badwater	application	was	due."
Book 2,"It	was	called	the	Hurt	100,
and	the	name	did	not	lie."
Book 2,"One	of	the	toughest	100-mile	trail	races	in	the	world,	it
was	set	in	a	triple	canopy	rainforest	on	the	island	of	Oahu."
Book 2,"To	cross	the	finish
line,	I’d	have	to	run	up	and	down	24,500	vertical	feet."
Book 2,"That’s	some	Himalayan
shit."
Book 2,I	stared	at	the	race	profile.
Book 2,It	was	all	sharp	spikes	and	deep	dives.
Book 2,"It	looked
like	an	arrhythmic	EKG."
Book 2,I	couldn’t	do	this	race	cold.
Book 2,"There’s	no	way	I	could
finish	it	without	at	least	some	training,	but	by	early	December	I	was	still	in	so
much	agony	that	walking	up	the	stairs	to	my	apartment	was	pure	torture."
Book 2,"The	following	weekend	I	zoomed	up	Interstate	15	to	Vegas	for	the	Las	Vegas
Marathon."
Book 2,It	wasn’t	spur	of	the	moment.
Book 2,"Months	before	I’d	ever	heard	the	words
“San	Diego	One	Day,”	Kate,	my	mom,	and	I	had	circled	December	5th	on	our
calendars."
Book 2,"It	was	2005,	the	first	year	that	the	Las	Vegas	Marathon	started	on	the
Strip,	and	we	wanted	to	be	part	of	that	shit."
Book 2,"Except	I	never	trained	for	it,	then	the
San	Diego	One	Day	happened,	and	by	the	time	we	got	to	Vegas	I	had	no
illusions	about	my	fitness	level."
Book 2,"I	tried	to	run	the	morning	before	we	left,	but	I
still	had	stress	fractures	in	my	feet,	my	medial	tendons	were	wobbly,	and	even
while	wrapped	with	a	special	bandage	I’d	found	that	could	stabilize	my	ankles,	I
couldn’t	last	longer	than	a	quarter	mile."
Book 2,"So	I	didn’t	plan	on	running	as	we	rocked
up	to	the	Mandalay	Bay	Casino	&	Resort	on	race	day."
Book 2,It	was	a	beautiful	morning.
Book 2,"Music	was	pumping,	there	were	thousands	of	smiling
faces	in	the	street,	the	clean	desert	air	had	a	chill	to	it,	and	the	sun	was	shining."
Book 2,"Running	conditions	don’t	get	much	better,	and	Kate	was	ready	to	go."
Book 2,"Her	goal
was	to	break	five	hours,	and	for	once,	I	was	satisfied	being	a	cheerleader."
Book 2,"My
mom	had	always	planned	on	walking	it,	and	I	figured	I’d	stroll	with	her	for	as
long	as	I	could,	then	hail	a	cab	to	the	finish	line	and	cheer	my	ladies	to	the	tape."
Book 2,"The	three	of	us	toed	up	with	the	masses	as	the	clock	struck	7	a.m.,	and	someone
got	on	the	mic	to	begin	the	official	count	down."
Book 2,"“Ten…nine…eight…”	When	he
hit	one,	a	horn	sounded,	and	like	Pavlov’s	dog	something	clicked	inside	me."
Book 2,"I
still	don’t	know	what	it	was."
Book 2,"Perhaps	I	underestimated	my	competitive	spirit.Maybe	it	was	because	I	knew	Navy	SEALs	were	supposed	to	be	the	hardest
motherfuckers	in	the	world."
Book 2,"We	were	supposed	to	run	on	broken	legs	and
fractured	feet."
Book 2,Or	so	went	the	legend	I’d	bought	into	long	ago.
Book 2,"Whatever	it	was,
something	triggered	and	the	last	thing	I	remember	seeing	as	the	horn	echoed
down	the	street	was	shock	and	real	concern	on	the	faces	of	Kate	and	my	mother
as	I	charged	down	the	boulevard	and	out	of	sight."
Book 2,"The	pain	was	serious	for	the	first	quarter	mile,	but	after	that	adrenaline	took
over."
Book 2,"I	hit	the	first	mile	marker	at	7:10	and	kept	running	like	the	asphalt	was
melting	behind	me."
Book 2,"Ten	kilometers	into	the	race,	my	time	was	around	forty-three
minutes."
Book 2,"That’s	solid,	but	I	wasn’t	focused	on	the	clock	because	considering	how
I’d	felt	the	day	before,	I	was	still	in	total	disbelief	that	I’d	actually	run	6.2	miles!
My	body	was	broken."
Book 2,How	was	this	happening?
Book 2,"Most	people	in	my	condition
would	have	both	feet	in	soft	casts,	and	here	I	was	running	a	marathon!
I	got	to	mile	thirteen,	the	halfway	point,	and	saw	the	official	clock."
Book 2,"It	read,
“1:35:55.”	I	did	the	math	and	realized	that	I	was	in	the	hunt	to	qualify	for	the
Boston	marathon,	but	was	right	on	the	cusp."
Book 2,"In	order	to	qualify	in	my	age	group,
I	had	to	finish	in	under	3:10:59."
Book 2,"I	laughed	in	disbelief	and	slammed	a	paper	cup
of	Gatorade."
Book 2,"In	less	than	two	hours	the	game	had	flipped,	and	I	might	never	get
this	chance	again."
Book 2,"I’d	seen	so	much	death	by	then—in	my	personal	life	and	on
the	battlefield—that	I	knew	tomorrow	was	not	guaranteed."
Book 2,"Before	me	was	an
opportunity,	and	if	you	give	me	an	opportunity,	I	will	break	that	motherfucker
off!
It	wasn’t	easy."
Book 2,"I’d	surfed	an	adrenaline	wave	for	the	first	thirteen	miles,	but	I	felt
every	inch	of	the	second	half,	and	at	mile	eighteen,	I	hit	a	wall."
Book 2,"That’s	a	common
theme	in	marathon	running,	because	mile	eighteen	is	usually	when	a	runner’s
glycogen	levels	run	low,	and	I	was	bonking,	my	lungs	heaving."
Book 2,"My	legs	felt	like
I	was	running	in	deep	Saharan	sand."
Book 2,"I	needed	to	stop	and	take	a	break,	but	I
refused,	and	two	hard	miles	later	I	felt	rejuvenated."
Book 2,"I	reached	the	next	clock	at
mile	twenty-two."
Book 2,"I	was	still	in	the	hunt	for	Boston,	though	I’d	fallen	thirty
seconds	off	the	pace,	and	to	qualify,	the	final	four	miles	would	have	to	be	my
very	best."
Book 2,"I	dug	deep,	kicked	my	thighs	up	high,	and	lengthened	my	stride."
Book 2,"I	was	a	man
possessed	as	I	turned	the	final	corner	and	charged	toward	the	finish	line	at	the
Mandalay	Bay."
Book 2,"Thousands	of	people	had	assembled	on	the	sidewalk,	cheering."
Book 2,Itwas	all	a	beautiful	blur	to	me	as	I	sprinted	home.
Book 2,"I	ran	my	last	two	miles	at	a	sub-seven-minute	pace,	finished	the	race	in	just	over
3:08,	and	qualified	for	Boston."
Book 2,"Somewhere	on	the	streets	of	Las	Vegas,	my	wife
and	mother	would	deal	with	their	own	struggles	and	overcome	them	to	finish
too,	and	as	I	sat	on	a	patch	of	grass,	waiting	for	them,	I	contemplated	another
simple	question	I	couldn’t	shake."
Book 2,"It	was	a	new	one,	and	wasn’t	fear-based,	pain-
spiked,	or	self-limiting."
Book 2,This	one	felt	open.
Book 2,What	am	I	capable	of?
Book 2,"SEAL	training	had	pushed	me	to	the	brink	several	times,	but	whenever	it	beat
me	down	I	popped	up	to	take	another	pounding."
Book 2,"That	experience	made	me	hard,
but	it	also	left	me	wanting	more	of	the	same,	and	day-to-day	Navy	SEAL	life
just	wasn’t	like	that."
Book 2,"Then	came	the	San	Diego	One	Day,	and	now	this."
Book 2,"I’d
finished	a	marathon	at	an	elite	pace	(for	a	weekend	warrior)	when	I	had	no
business	even	walking	a	mile."
Book 2,"Both	were	incredible	physical	feats	that	didn’t
seem	possible."
Book 2,But	they’d	happened.
Book 2,What	am	I	capable	of?
Book 2,"I	couldn’t	answer	that	question,	but	as	I	looked	around	the	finish	line	that	day
and	considered	what	I’d	accomplished,	it	became	clear	that	we	are	all	leaving	a
lot	of	money	on	the	table	without	realizing	it."
Book 2,"We	habitually	settle	for	less	than
our	best;	at	work,	in	school,	in	our	relationships,	and	on	the	playing	field	or	race
course."
Book 2,"We	settle	as	individuals,	and	we	teach	our	children	to	settle	for	less	than
their	best,	and	all	of	that	ripples	out,	merges,	and	multiplies	within	our
communities	and	society	as	a	whole."
Book 2,"We’re	not	talking	some	bad	weekend	in
Vegas,	no	more	cash	at	the	ATM	kind	of	loss	either."
Book 2,"In	that	moment,	the	cost	of
missing	out	on	so	much	excellence	in	this	eternally	fucked-up	world	felt
incalculable	to	me,	and	it	still	does."
Book 2,I	haven’t	stopped	thinking	about	it	since.
Book 2,"***
Physically,	I	bounced	back	from	Vegas	within	a	few	days."
Book 2,"Meaning	I	was	back
to	my	new	normal:	dealing	with	the	same	serious	yet	tolerable	pain	I’d	come
home	to	after	the	San	Diego	One	Day."
Book 2,"The	aches	were	still	there	by	the
following	Saturday,	but	I	was	done	convalescing."
Book 2,"I	needed	to	start	training	or	I’dburn	out	on	the	trail	during	the	Hurt	100,	and	there	would	be	no	Badwater."
Book 2,"I’d
been	reading	up	on	how	to	prepare	for	ultras	and	knew	it	was	vital	to	get	in	some
hundred-mile	weeks."
Book 2,"I	only	had	about	a	month	to	build	my	strength	and
endurance	before	race	day	on	January	14th."
Book 2,"My	feet	and	shins	weren’t	even	close	to	right,	so	I	came	up	with	a	new	method
to	stabilize	both	the	bones	in	my	feet	and	my	tendons."
Book 2,"I	bought	high
performance	inserts,	cut	them	down	to	fit	flush	with	the	soles	of	my	feet,	and
taped	my	ankles,	heels,	and	lower	shins	with	compression	tape."
Book 2,"I	also	slid	a
small	heel	wedge	into	my	shoes	to	correct	my	running	posture	and	ease	pressure."
Book 2,"After	what	I’d	endured,	it	took	a	lot	of	props	to	get	me	running	(nearly)	pain
free."
Book 2,"Getting	hundred-mile	weeks	in	while	holding	down	a	steady	job	isn’t	easy,	but
that	was	no	excuse."
Book 2,"My	sixteen-mile	commute	to	work	from	Chula	Vista	to
Coronado	became	my	go-to	run."
Book 2,"Chula	Vista	had	a	split	personality	when	I	lived
there."
Book 2,"There	was	the	nicer,	newer,	middle	class	section,	where	we	lived,	which
was	surrounded	by	a	concrete	jungle	of	gritty,	dangerous	streets."
Book 2,"That’s	the	part	I
ran	through	at	dawn,	beneath	freeway	overpasses,	and	alongside	Home	Depot
shipping	bays."
Book 2,This	was	not	your	tourist	brochure’s	version	of	sunny	San	Diego.
Book 2,"I	sniffed	car	exhaust	and	rotting	garbage,	spotted	skittering	rats,	and	dodged
sleepless	homeless	camps	before	reaching	Imperial	Beach,	where	I	picked	up	the
seven-mile	Silver	Strand	bike	path."
Book 2,"It	banked	south	past	Coronado’s	landmark
hotel,	the	turn	of	the	century	Hotel	Del	Coronado,	and	a	crop	of	luxury	condo
towers	which	overlooked	the	same	wide	strip	of	sand	shared	by	Naval	Special
Warfare	Command,	where	I	spent	the	day	jumping	out	of	airplanes	and	shooting
guns."
Book 2,"I	was	living	the	Navy	SEAL	legend,	trying	to	keep	it	real!
I	ran	that	sixteen-mile	stretch	at	least	three	times	a	week."
Book 2,"Some	days	I	ran	home
too,	and	on	Fridays	I	added	a	ruck	run."
Book 2,"Inside	the	radio	pouch	of	my	standard
issue	ruck	sack,	I	slid	two	twenty-five-pound	weights	and	ran	fully	loaded	for	as
many	as	twenty	miles	to	build	quad	strength."
Book 2,"I	loved	waking	up	at	5	a.m.	and
starting	work	with	three	hours	of	cardio	already	in	the	bank	while	most	of	my
teammates	hadn’t	even	finished	their	coffee."
Book 2,"It	gave	me	a	mental	edge,	a	better
sense	of	self-awareness,	and	a	ton	of	self-confidence,	which	made	me	a	better
SEAL	instructor."
Book 2,"That’s	what	getting	up	at	the	ass	crack	of	dawn	and	putting	out
will	do	for	you."
Book 2,"It	makes	you	better	in	all	facets	of	your	life.During	my	first	real	deal	week	of	training,	I	ran	seventy-seven	miles."
Book 2,"The
following	week,	I	ran	109	miles,	including	a	twelve-mile	run	on	Christmas	Day."
Book 2,"The	next	week	I	pushed	it	to	111.5,	including	a	nineteen-mile	run	on	New	Year’s
Day,	and	the	following	week	I	backed	off	to	taper	my	legs,	but	still	got	56.5
miles	in."
Book 2,"All	of	those	were	road	miles,	but	what	I	had	coming	up	was	a	trail	run,
and	I	had	never	run	on	a	trail	before."
Book 2,"I’d	bushwhacked	a	bunch,	but	I	hadn’t	run
distance	on	single	track	with	a	clock	running."
Book 2,"The	Hurt	100	was	a	twenty-mile
circuit	course,	and	I’d	heard	that	only	a	slim	slice	of	those	who	start	the	race
finish	all	five	laps."
Book 2,This	was	my	last	chance	to	pad	my	Badwater	resume.
Book 2,"I	had	a
lot	riding	on	a	successful	outcome,	and	there	was	so	much	about	the	race,	and
about	ultra	running,	that	I	still	didn’t	know.Hurt	100	Week	3	training	log
I	flew	into	Honolulu	a	few	days	early	and	checked	into	the	Halekoa,	a	military
hotel	where	active	duty	and	veterans	stay	with	their	families	when	they	come
through	town."
Book 2,"I’d	studied	the	maps	and	knew	the	basics	when	it	came	to	the
terrain,	but	I	hadn’t	seen	it	up	close,	so	I	drove	over	to	the	Hawaii	Nature	Center
the	day	before	the	race	and	stared	into	the	velvety,	jade	mountains."
Book 2,"All	I	could
see	was	a	steep	cut	of	red	earth	disappearing	into	the	dense	green."
Book 2,"I	walked	up
the	trail	for	a	half	mile,	but	there	was	only	so	far	I	could	hike."
Book 2,"I	was	tapering,
and	the	first	mile	was	straight	uphill."
Book 2,"Everything	beyond	that	would	have	to
remain	a	mystery	for	a	little	longer."
Book 2,"There	were	just	three	aid	stations	on	the	twenty-mile	course,	and	most	athletes
were	self-reliant	and	dialed	in	their	own	nutritional	regimen."
Book 2,"I	was	still	a
neophyte,	and	had	no	clue	what	I	needed	when	it	came	to	fuel."
Book 2,"I	met	a	woman	at
the	hotel	at	5:30	a.m.	on	race	day	morning	as	we	were	about	to	leave."
Book 2,"She	knew	I
was	a	rookie	and	asked	what	I’d	brought	with	me	to	keep	myself	going."
Book 2,"I
showed	her	my	meager	stash	of	flavored	energy	gels,	and	my	CamelBak."
Book 2,"“You	didn’t	bring	salt	pills?”	she	asked,	shocked."
Book 2,I	shrugged.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	what
the	fuck	a	salt	pill	was."
Book 2,She	poured	a	hundred	of	them	into	my	palm.
Book 2,"“Take	two
of	these,	every	hour."
Book 2,"They’ll	keep	you	from	cramping.”
“Roger	that.”	She	smiled	and	shook	her	head	like	she	could	see	my	fucked-up
future."
Book 2,"I	had	a	strong	start	and	felt	great,	but	not	long	after	the	race	began	I	knew	I	was
facing	a	monster	course."
Book 2,I’m	not	talking	about	the	grade	and	elevation	variance.
Book 2,I	expected	that.
Book 2,It	was	all	the	rocks	and	roots	that	took	me	by	surprise.
Book 2,"I	was
lucky	that	it	hadn’t	rained	in	a	couple	of	days	because	all	I	had	to	wear	were	my
standard	running	shoes,	which	had	precious	little	tread."
Book 2,"Then	my	CamelBak
broke	at	mile	six."
Book 2,"I	shook	it	off	and	kept	hammering,	but	without	a	water	source,	I’d	have	to	rely
on	the	aid	stations	to	hydrate,	and	they	were	spaced	miles	apart."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	even
have	my	support	crew	(of	one)	yet."
Book 2,"Kate	was	chilling	on	the	beach	and	didn’t
plan	on	showing	up	until	later	in	the	race,	which	was	was	my	own	fault."
Book 2,"I	enticed
her	to	come	along	by	promising	a	vacation,	and	early	that	morning	I	insisted	sheenjoy	Hawaii	and	leave	the	suffering	to	me."
Book 2,"With	or	without	a	CamelBak,	my
mindset	was	to	make	it	from	aid	station	to	aid	station	and	see	what	happens."
Book 2,Before	the	race	started	I	heard	people	talking	about	Karl	Meltzer.
Book 2,"I’d	seen	him
stretching	out	and	warming	up."
Book 2,"His	nickname	was	the	Speedgoat,	and	he	was
trying	to	become	the	first	person	ever	to	complete	the	race	in	less	than	twenty-
four	hours."
Book 2,For	the	rest	of	us	there	was	a	thirty-six	hour	time	limit.
Book 2,"My	first	lap
took	four	and	a	half	hours,	and	I	felt	okay	afterwards,	which	was	to	be	expected
considering	all	the	long	days	I’d	done	in	preparation,	but	I	was	also	concerned
because	each	lap	demanded	an	ascent	and	descent	of	around	5,000	vertical	feet,
and	the	amount	of	focus	it	took	to	pay	attention	to	every	step	so	I	didn’t	turn	an
ankle	amped	up	my	mental	fatigue."
Book 2,"Each	time	my	medial	tendon	twinged	it	felt
like	a	raw	nerve	exposed	to	the	wind,	and	I	knew	one	stumble	could	fold	my
wobbly	ankle	and	end	my	race."
Book 2,"I	felt	that	pressure	every	single	moment,	and	as	a
result,	I	burned	more	calories	than	expected."
Book 2,"Which	was	a	problem	because	I	had
very	little	fuel,	and	without	a	water	source,	I	couldn’t	hydrate	effectively."
Book 2,"Between	laps,	I	guzzled	water,	and	with	my	belly	sloshing	started	my	second
loop,	with	a	slow	jog	up	that	one-mile-long,	800-foot	climb	into	the	mountains
(basically	straight	uphill)."
Book 2,That’s	when	it	started	to	rain.
Book 2,"Our	red	earth	trail
became	mud	within	minutes."
Book 2,"The	soles	of	my	shoes	were	coated	with	it	and	slick
as	skis."
Book 2,"I	sloshed	through	shin	deep	puddles,	skidded	down	descents,	and	slipped
on	ascents."
Book 2,It	was	a	full-body	sport.
Book 2,But	at	least	there	was	water.
Book 2,"Whenever	I	was
dry	I	tipped	my	head	back,	opened	wide,	and	tasted	the	rain,	which	filtered
through	a	triple	canopy	jungle	that	smelled	of	leaf	rot	and	shit."
Book 2,"The	feral	funk	of
fertility	invaded	my	nostrils,	and	all	I	could	think	of	was	the	fact	that	I	had	to	run
four	more	fucking	laps!
At	mile	thirty,	my	body	reported	some	positive	news."
Book 2,"Or	maybe	it	was	the
physical	manifestation	of	a	backhanded	compliment?"
Book 2,"The	tendon	pain	in	my
ankles	had	vanished…because	my	feet	had	swollen	enough	to	stabilize	those
tendons."
Book 2,Was	this	a	good	thing	long-term?
Book 2,"Probably	not,	but	you	take	what	you
can	get	on	the	ultra	circuit,	where	you	have	to	roll	with	whatever	gets	you	from
mile	to	mile."
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	my	quads	and	calves	ached	like	they’d	been	thumped
with	a	sledgehammer."
Book 2,"Yeah,	I	had	done	a	lot	of	running,	but	most	of	it—
including	my	ruck	runs—on	pancake	flat	terrain	in	San	Diego,	not	on	slick
jungle	trails.Kate	was	waiting	for	me	by	the	time	I	completed	my	second	lap,	and	after
spending	a	relaxing	morning	on	Waikiki	beach,	she	watched	in	horror	as	I
materialized	from	the	mist	like	a	zombie	from	the	Walking	Dead."
Book 2,"I	sat	and
guzzled	as	much	water	as	I	could."
Book 2,"By	then,	word	had	gotten	out	that	it	was	my
first	trail	race."
Book 2,"Have	you	ever	had	a	very	public	fuck-up,	or	were	in	the	midst	of	a	shitty
day/week/month/year,	yet	people	around	you	felt	obliged	to	comment	on	the
source	of	your	humiliation?"
Book 2,"Maybe	they	reminded	you	of	all	the	ways	you	could
have	ensured	a	very	different	outcome?"
Book 2,"Now	imagine	consuming	that	negativity,
but	having	to	run	sixty	more	miles	in	the	sweaty,	jungle	rain	on	top	of	it."
Book 2,"Does
that	sound	like	fun?"
Book 2,"Yeah,	I	was	the	talk	of	the	race."
Book 2,"Well,	me	and	Karl	Meltzer."
Book 2,"Nobody	could	believe	he	was	gunning	for	a	sub-twenty-four-hour	experience,
and	it	was	equally	baffling	that	I	showed	up	to	one	of	the	most	treacherous	trail
races	on	the	planet,	undersupplied	and	unprepared,	with	no	trail	races	under	my
belt."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	began	my	third	loop	there	were	only	forty	athletes,	out	of
nearly	a	hundred,	left	in	the	race,	and	I	started	running	with	a	guy	named	Luis
Escobar."
Book 2,"For	the	tenth	time	I	heard	the	following	words:
“So	it’s	your	first	trail	race?”	he	asked."
Book 2,I	nodded.
Book 2,"“You	really	picked	the
wrong…”
“I	know,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“It’s	just	such	a	technical…”
“Right."
Book 2,I’m	a	fucking	idiot.
Book 2,"I’ve	heard	that	a	lot	today.”
“That’s	okay,”	he	said,	“we’re	all	of	bunch	of	idiots	out	here,	man.”	He	handed
me	a	water	bottle."
Book 2,He	was	carrying	three	of	them.
Book 2,“Take	this.
Book 2,"I	heard	about	your
CamelBak.”
This	being	my	second	race,	I	was	starting	to	understand	the	rhythm	of	ultra."
Book 2,"It’s
a	constant	dance	between	competition	and	camaraderie,	which	reminded	me	of
BUD/S."
Book 2,"Luis	and	I	were	both	racing	the	clock	and	each	other,	but	we	wanted	one
another	to	make	it."
Book 2,"We	were	in	it	alone,	together,	and	he	was	right."
Book 2,"We	were	a
couple	of	fucking	idiots.Darkness	descended	and	left	us	with	a	pitch-black	jungle	night."
Book 2,"Running	side	by
side,	the	glow	of	our	headlamps	merged	and	shed	a	wider	light,	but	once	we
separated	all	I	could	see	was	a	yellow	ball	bouncing	on	the	trail	ahead	of	me."
Book 2,"Countless	trip	wires—shin-high	logs,	slick	roots,	lichen-wrapped	rocks—
remained	out	of	sight."
Book 2,"I	slipped,	stumbled,	fell,	and	cursed."
Book 2,"Jungle	noises	were
everywhere."
Book 2,It	wasn’t	just	the	insect	world	that	had	my	attention.
Book 2,"In	Hawaii,	on
all	the	islands,	bow	hunting	for	wild	pig	in	the	mountains	is	a	major	pastime,	and
master	hunters	often	leave	their	pit	bulls	chained	up	in	the	jungle	to	develop	a
nose	for	swine."
Book 2,"I	heard	every	one	of	those	hungry	bulls	snapping	and	growling,
and	I	heard	some	pigs	squealing	too."
Book 2,"I	smelled	their	fear	and	rage,	their	piss	and
shit,	their	sour	fucking	breath."
Book 2,"With	each	nearby	bark	or	yelp,	my	heart	skipped	and	I	jumped	on	terrain	so	slick
that	injury	was	a	real	possibility."
Book 2,"One	wrong	step	could	roll	my	ass	out	of	the
race	and	out	of	contention	for	Badwater."
Book 2,"I	could	picture	Kostman	hearing	the
news	and	nodding	like	he	figured	that	shit	would	happen	all	along."
Book 2,"I	know	him
pretty	well	now,	and	he	was	never	out	to	get	me,	but	that’s	how	my	mind	worked
back	then."
Book 2,"And	in	the	steep,	dark	mountains	of	Oahu,	my	exhaustion	magnified
my	stress."
Book 2,"I	felt	close	to	my	absolute	limit,	but	still	had	more	than	forty	miles	to
go!
On	the	backside	of	the	course,	after	a	long	technical	descent	into	the	dark,	dank
forest	I	saw	another	headlamp	circling	ahead	of	me	in	a	cutout	on	the	trail."
Book 2,"The
runner	was	moving	in	curlicues	and	when	I	caught	up	to	him	I	could	see	it	was	a
Hungarian	runner	I’d	met	in	San	Diego	named	Akos	Konya."
Book 2,"He	was	one	of	the
best	runners	in	the	field	on	Hospitality	Point,	where	he	covered	134	miles	in
twenty-four	hours."
Book 2,I	liked	Akos	and	had	mad	respect	for	him.
Book 2,"I	stopped	and
watched	him	move	in	conjoining	circles,	covering	the	same	terrain	over	and	over
again."
Book 2,Was	he	looking	for	something?
Book 2,Was	he	hallucinating?
Book 2,"“Akos,”	I	asked,	“you	okay,	man?"
Book 2,"Do	you	need	some	help?”
“David,	no!	I…no,	I’m	fine,”	he	said."
Book 2,His	eyes	were	full-moon	flying	saucers.
Book 2,"He	was	in	delirium,	but	I	was	barely	hanging	on	myself	and	wasn’t	sure	what	I
could	do	for	him	other	than	tell	staff	at	the	next	aid	station	he	was	wandering	in
a	daze."
Book 2,"Like	I	said,	there’s	camaraderie	and	there’s	competition	on	the	ultra
circuit,	and	since	he	wasn’t	in	obvious	pain	and	refused	my	help,	I	had	to	go	into
barbarian	mode."
Book 2,"With	two	full	laps	to	go,	I	had	no	choice	but	to	keep	moving.I	staggered	back	to	the	start	line	and	slumped	into	my	chair,	dazed."
Book 2,"It	was	dark
as	space,	the	temperature	was	dropping,	and	rain	was	still	pissing	down."
Book 2,"I	was	at
the	very	edge	of	my	capability,	and	wasn’t	sure	that	I	could	take	one	more	step."
Book 2,"I
felt	like	I’d	drained	99	percent	from	my	tank,	at	least."
Book 2,"My	gas	light	was	on,	my
engine	shuddering,	yet	I	knew	I	had	to	find	more	if	I	was	going	to	finish	this	race
and	get	myself	into	Badwater."
Book 2,But	how	do	you	push	yourself	when	pain	is	all	you	feel	with	every	step?
Book 2,"When
agony	is	the	feedback	loop	that	permeates	each	cell	in	your	body,	begging	you	to
stop?"
Book 2,That’s	tricky	because	the	threshold	for	suffering	is	different	for	everybody.
Book 2,What’s	universal	is	the	impulse	to	succumb.
Book 2,"To	feel	like	you’ve	given
everything	you	can,	and	that	you	are	justified	in	leaving	a	job	undone."
Book 2,"By	now,	I’m	sure	you	can	tell	that	it	doesn’t	take	much	for	me	to	become
obsessed."
Book 2,"Some	criticize	my	level	of	passion,	but	I’m	not	down	with	the
prevailing	mentalities	that	tend	to	dominate	American	society	these	days;	the
ones	that	tell	us	to	go	with	the	flow	or	invite	us	to	learn	how	to	get	more	with
less	effort."
Book 2,Fuck	that	shortcut	bullshit.
Book 2,"The	reason	I	embrace	my	own	obsessions
and	demand	and	desire	more	of	myself	is	because	I’ve	learned	that	it’s	only
when	I	push	beyond	pain	and	suffering,	past	my	perceived	limitations,	that	I’m
capable	of	accomplishing	more,	physically	and	mentally—in	endurance	races
but	also	in	life	as	a	whole."
Book 2,And	I	believe	the	same	is	true	for	you.
Book 2,The	human	body	is	like	a	stock	car.
Book 2,"We	may	look	different	on	the	outside,	but
under	the	hood	we	all	have	huge	reservoirs	of	potential	and	a	governor	impeding
us	from	reaching	our	maximum	velocity."
Book 2,"In	a	car,	the	governor	limits	the	flow	of
fuel	and	air	so	it	doesn’t	burn	too	hot,	which	places	a	ceiling	on	performance."
Book 2,"It’s	a	hardware	issue;	the	governor	can	easily	be	removed,	and	if	you	disable
yours,	watch	your	car	rocket	beyond	130	mph."
Book 2,It’s	a	subtler	process	in	the	human	animal.
Book 2,"Our	governor	is	buried	deep	in	our	minds,	intertwined	with	our	very	identity."
Book 2,"It
knows	what	and	who	we	love	and	hate;	it’s	read	our	whole	life	story	and	forms
the	way	we	see	ourselves	and	how	we’d	like	to	be	seen."
Book 2,"It’s	the	software	that
delivers	personalized	feedback—in	the	form	of	pain	and	exhaustion,	but	alsofear	and	insecurity,	and	it	uses	all	of	that	to	encourage	us	to	stop	before	we	risk	it
all."
Book 2,"But,	here’s	the	thing,	it	doesn’t	have	absolute	control."
Book 2,"Unlike	the	governor	in
an	engine,	ours	can’t	stop	us	unless	we	buy	into	its	bullshit	and	agree	to	quit."
Book 2,"Sadly,	most	of	us	give	up	when	we’ve	only	given	around	40	percent	of	our
maximum	effort."
Book 2,"Even	when	we	feel	like	we’ve	reached	our	absolute	limit,	we
still	have	60	percent	more	to	give!	That’s	the	governor	in	action!	Once	you	know
that	to	be	true,	it’s	simply	a	matter	of	stretching	your	pain	tolerance,	letting	go	of
your	identity	and	all	your	self-limiting	stories,	so	you	can	get	to	60	percent,	then
80	percent	and	beyond	without	giving	up."
Book 2,"I	call	this	The	40%	Rule,	and	the
reason	it’s	so	powerful	is	that	if	you	follow	it,	you	will	unlock	your	mind	to	new
levels	of	performance	and	excellence	in	sports	and	in	life,	and	your	rewards	will
run	far	deeper	than	mere	material	success."
Book 2,The	40%	Rule	can	be	applied	to	everything	we	do.
Book 2,"Because	in	life	almost
nothing	will	turn	out	exactly	as	we	hope."
Book 2,"There	are	always	challenges,	and
whether	we	are	at	work	or	school,	or	feeling	tested	within	our	most	intimate	or
important	relationships,	we	will	all	be	tempted	to	walk	away	from	commitments,
give	up	on	our	goals	and	dreams,	and	sell	our	own	happiness	short	at	some	point."
Book 2,"Because	we	will	feel	empty,	like	we	have	no	more	to	give,	when	we	haven’t
tapped	even	half	of	the	treasure	buried	deep	in	our	minds,	hearts,	and	souls."
Book 2,I	know	how	it	feels	to	be	approaching	an	energetic	dead	end.
Book 2,"I’ve	been	there	too
many	times	to	count."
Book 2,"I	understand	the	temptation	to	sell	short,	but	I	also	know
that	impulse	is	driven	by	your	mind’s	desire	for	comfort,	and	it’s	not	telling	you
the	truth."
Book 2,"It’s	your	identity	trying	to	find	sanctuary,	not	help	you	grow."
Book 2,"It’s
looking	for	status	quo,	not	reaching	for	greatness	or	seeking	wholeness."
Book 2,"But	the
software	update	that	you	need	to	shut	your	governor	down	is	no	supersonic
download."
Book 2,"It	takes	twenty	years	to	gain	twenty	years	of	experience,	and	the	only
way	to	move	beyond	your	40	percent	is	to	callous	your	mind,	day	after	day."
Book 2,"Which	means	you’ll	have	to	chase	pain	like	it’s	your	damn	job!
Imagine	you’re	a	boxer,	and	on	your	first	day	in	the	ring	you	take	one	on	your
chin."
Book 2,"It’s	gonna	hurt	like	fucking	hell,	but	at	year	ten	of	being	a	boxer,	you	won’t
be	stopped	by	one	punch."
Book 2,"You’ll	be	able	to	absorb	twelve	rounds	of	getting	beat
the	fuck	down	and	come	back	the	very	next	day	and	fight	again."
Book 2,"It’s	not	that	the
punch	has	lost	power."
Book 2,Your	opponents	will	be	even	stronger.
Book 2,"The	change	has
happened	within	your	brain."
Book 2,You’ve	calloused	your	mind.
Book 2,"Over	a	period	of	time,your	tolerance	for	mental	and	physical	suffering	will	have	expanded	because
your	software	will	have	learned	that	you	can	take	a	hell	of	a	lot	more	than	one
punch,	and	if	you	stay	with	any	task	that	is	trying	to	beat	you	down,	you	will
reap	rewards."
Book 2,Not	a	fighter?
Book 2,Say	you	like	to	run	but	have	a	broken	pinky	toe.
Book 2,"I’ll	bet	if	you
continue	running	on	it,	pretty	soon	you’ll	be	able	to	run	on	broken	legs."
Book 2,"Sounds
impossible,	right?"
Book 2,"I	know	it’s	true,	because	I’ve	run	on	broken	legs,	and	that
knowledge	helped	me	endure	all	manner	of	agonies	on	the	ultra	circuit,	which
has	revealed	a	clear	spring	of	self	confidence	that	I	drink	from	whenever	my
tank	is	dry."
Book 2,But	nobody	taps	their	reserve	60	percent	right	away	or	all	at	once.
Book 2,"The	first	step
is	to	remember	that	your	initial	blast	of	pain	and	fatigue	is	your	governor	talking."
Book 2,"Once	you	do	that,	you	are	in	control	of	the	dialogue	in	your	mind,	and	you	can
remind	yourself	that	you	are	not	as	drained	as	you	think."
Book 2,"That	you	haven’t	given
it	your	all."
Book 2,Not	even	close.
Book 2,"Buying	into	that	will	keep	you	in	the	fight,	and	that’s
worth	an	extra	5	percent."
Book 2,"Of	course,	that’s	easier	read	than	done."
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	easy	to	begin	the	fourth	lap	of	the	Hurt	100	because	I	knew	how	much
it	would	hurt,	and	when	you	are	feeling	dead	and	buried,	dehydrated,	wrung	out,
and	torn	the	fuck	up	at	40	percent,	finding	that	extra	60	percent	feels	impossible."
Book 2,I	didn’t	want	my	suffering	to	continue.
Book 2,"Nobody	does!	That’s	why	the	line
“fatigue	makes	cowards	of	us	all”	is	true	as	shit."
Book 2,"Mind	you,	I	didn’t	know	anything	about	The	40%	Rule	that	day."
Book 2,"The	Hurt	100	is
when	I	first	started	to	contemplate	it,	but	I	had	hit	the	wall	many	times	before,
and	I	had	learned	to	stay	present	and	open	minded	enough	to	recalibrate	my
goals	even	at	my	lowest."
Book 2,"I	knew	that	staying	in	the	fight	is	always	the	hardest,
and	most	rewarding,	first	step."
Book 2,"Of	course,	it’s	easy	to	be	open	minded	when	you	leave	yoga	class	and	are	taking
a	stroll	by	the	beach,	but	when	you’re	suffering,	keeping	an	open	mind	is	hard
work."
Book 2,"The	same	is	true	if	you	are	facing	a	daunting	challenge	on	the	job	or	at
school."
Book 2,"Maybe	you	are	tackling	a	hundred-question	test	and	know	that	you’ve
bricked	the	first	fifty."
Book 2,"At	that	point,	it’s	extremely	difficult	to	maintain	the
necessary	discipline	to	force	yourself	to	keep	taking	the	test	seriously."
Book 2,"It’s	also
imperative	that	you	find	it	because	in	every	failure	there	is	something	to	begained,	even	if	it’s	only	practice	for	the	next	test	you’ll	have	to	take."
Book 2,"Because
that	next	test	is	coming."
Book 2,That’s	a	guarantee.
Book 2,I	didn’t	start	my	fourth	lap	with	any	sort	of	conviction.
Book 2,"I	was	in	wait-and-see
mode,	and	halfway	up	that	first	climb	I	became	so	dizzy	I	had	to	sit	under	a	tree
for	a	while."
Book 2,"Two	runners	passed	me,	one	at	a	time."
Book 2,"They	checked	in	but	I	waved
them	on."
Book 2,Told	them	I	was	just	fine.
Book 2,"Yeah,	I	was	doing	great."
Book 2,I	was	a	regular	Akos	Konya.
Book 2,"From	my	vantage	point	I	could	see	the	crest	of	the	hill	above	and	encouraged
myself	to	walk	at	least	that	far."
Book 2,"If	I	still	wanted	to	quit	after	that,	I	told	myself
that	I	would	be	willing	to	sign	off,	and	that	there	is	no	shame	in	not	finishing	the
Hurt	100."
Book 2,"I	said	that	to	myself	again	and	again	because	that’s	how	our	governor
works."
Book 2,It	massages	your	ego	even	as	it	stops	you	short	of	your	goals.
Book 2,"But	once	I
got	to	the	top	of	the	climb,	the	higher	ground	gave	me	a	new	perspective	and	I
saw	another	place	off	in	the	distance	and	decided	to	cover	that	small	stretch	of
mud,	rock,	and	root	too—you	know,	before	quitting	for	good."
Book 2,"Once	I	got	there	I	was	staring	down	a	long	descent	and	even	though	the	footing
was	troubling,	it	still	looked	much	easier	than	going	uphill."
Book 2,"Without	realizing	it,
I’d	gotten	to	a	point	where	I	was	able	to	strategize."
Book 2,"On	the	first	climb,	I	was	so
dizzy	and	weak	I	was	swept	into	a	moment	of	fuck,	which	clogged	my	brain."
Book 2,There	was	no	room	for	strategy.
Book 2,"I	just	wanted	to	quit,	but	by	moving	a	little	bit
further	I’d	reset	my	brain."
Book 2,"I’d	calmed	down	and	realized	I	could	chunk	the	race
down	to	size,	and	staying	in	the	game	like	that	gave	me	hope,	and	hope	is
addictive."
Book 2,"I	chunked	the	race	out	that	way,	collecting	5	percent	chips,	unlocking	more
energy,	then	burning	it	up	as	time	bled	into	the	wee	hours."
Book 2,"I	became	so	tired	I
damn	near	fell	asleep	on	my	feet,	and	that’s	dangerous	on	a	trail	with	so	many
switchbacks	and	drop	offs."
Book 2,"Any	runner	could	have	easily	sleepwalked	into
oblivion."
Book 2,The	one	thing	keeping	me	awake	was	the	piss-poor	trail	condition.
Book 2,"I
fell	on	my	ass	dozens	of	times."
Book 2,My	street	shoes	were	out	of	their	element.
Book 2,"It	felt
like	I	was	running	on	ice,	and	the	inevitable	fall	was	always	jarring,	but	at	least	it
woke	me	up."
Book 2,"By	running	a	little	while,	then	walking	a	stretch,	I	was	able	to	forge	ahead	tomile	seventy-seven,	the	toughest	descent	of	them	all,	which	is	when	I	saw	Karl
Meltzer,	the	Speedgoat,	crest	the	hill	behind	me."
Book 2,"He	wore	a	lamp	on	his	head	and
another	on	his	wrist,	and	a	hip	pack	with	two	big	water	bottles."
Book 2,"Silhouetted	in
pink	dawn	light	he	charged	down	slope,	navigating	a	section	that	had	me
stumbling	and	groping	for	tree	branches	to	stay	upright."
Book 2,"He	was	about	to	lap	me,
three	miles	from	the	finish	line,	on	pace	for	a	course	record,	twenty-two	hours
and	sixteen	minutes,	but	what	I	remember	most	is	how	graceful	he	looked
running	at	an	incredible	6:30	per	mile	pace."
Book 2,"He	was	levitating	over	the	mud,
riding	a	whole	different	Zen."
Book 2,"His	feet	barely	touched	the	ground,	and	it	was	a
beautiful	fucking	sight."
Book 2,"The	Speedgoat	was	the	living,	breathing	answer	to	the
question	that	colonized	my	mind	after	the	Las	Vegas	marathon."
Book 2,What	am	I	capable	of?
Book 2,"Watching	that	bad	man	glide	across	the	most	challenging	terrain	made	me
realize	that	there	is	a	whole	other	level	of	athlete	out	there	in	the	world,	and	that
some	of	that	was	inside	me	too."
Book 2,"In	fact,	it’s	in	all	of	us."
Book 2,"I’m	not	saying	that
genetics	don’t	play	a	role	in	athletic	performance,	or	that	everyone	has	an
undiscovered	ability	to	run	a	four-minute	mile,	dunk	like	LeBron	James,	shoot
like	Steph	Curry,	or	run	the	Hurt	100	in	twenty-two	hours."
Book 2,"We	don’t	all	have	the
same	floor	or	ceiling,	but	we	each	have	a	lot	more	in	us	than	we	know,	and	when
it	comes	to	endurance	sports	like	ultra	running,	everyone	can	achieve	feats	they
once	thought	impossible."
Book 2,"In	order	to	do	that	we	must	change	our	minds,	be
willing	to	scrap	our	identity,	and	make	the	extra	effort	to	always	find	more	in
order	to	become	more."
Book 2,We	must	remove	our	governor.
Book 2,"That	day	on	the	Hurt	100	circuit,	after	seeing	Meltzer	run	like	a	superhero,	I
finished	my	fourth	lap	in	all	kinds	of	pain	and	took	time	to	watch	him	celebrate,
surrounded	by	his	team."
Book 2,"He’d	just	achieved	something	nobody	had	ever	done
before	and	here	I	was	with	another	full	lap	to	go."
Book 2,"My	legs	were	rubber,	my	feet
swollen."
Book 2,"I	did	not	want	to	go	on,	but	I	also	knew	that	was	my	pain	talking."
Book 2,"My
true	potential	was	still	undetermined."
Book 2,"Looking	back,	I’d	say	I’d	given	60	percent,
which	meant	my	tank	was	just	shy	of	half-full."
Book 2,"I’d	like	to	sit	here	and	tell	you	I	went	all-out	and	drained	that	fucker	on	lap	five,
but	I	was	still	a	mere	tourist	on	planet	ultra."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	the	master	of	my	mind.
Book 2,"Iwas	in	the	laboratory,	still	in	discovery	mode,	and	I	walked	every	single	step	of
my	fifth	and	final	lap."
Book 2,"It	took	me	eight	hours,	but	the	rain	had	stopped,	the
tropical	glow	of	the	warm	Hawaiian	sun	felt	phenomenal,	and	I	got	the	job	done."
Book 2,"I	finished	Hurt	100	in	thirty-three	hours	and	twenty-three	minutes,	just	shy	of	the
thirty-six-hour	cut	off,	good	enough	for	ninth	place."
Book 2,"Only	twenty-three	athletes
finished	the	entire	race,	and	I	was	one	of	them."
Book 2,"I	was	so	thrashed	afterward,	two	people	carried	me	to	the	car,	and	Kate	had	to
spin	me	up	to	my	room	in	a	damn	wheelchair."
Book 2,"When	we	got	there,	we	had	more
work	to	do."
Book 2,"I	wanted	to	get	my	Badwater	application	done	ASAP,	so	without	so
much	as	a	cat	nap,	we	polished	that	shit	up."
Book 2,"Within	a	matter	of	days,	Kostman	emailed	me	to	let	me	know	that	I	had	been
accepted	into	Badwater."
Book 2,It	was	a	great	feeling.
Book 2,"It	also	meant	that	for	the	next	six
months	I	had	two	full-time	jobs."
Book 2,"I	was	a	Navy	SEAL	in	full	preparation	mode	for
Badwater."
Book 2,"This	time	I	would	get	strategic	and	specific	because	I	knew	that	in
order	to	unleash	my	best	performance—if	I	wanted	to	blow	past	40	percent,
drain	my	tank,	and	tap	my	full	potential—I	had	to	first	give	myself	an
opportunity."
Book 2,I	didn’t	research	or	prepare	for	the	Hurt	100	well	enough.
Book 2,"I	hadn’t	anticipated
the	rough	terrain,	I	had	no	support	crew	for	the	first	part	of	the	race,	and	I	had	no
back-up	water	source."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	bring	two	headlamps,	which	would	have	helped
during	the	long,	bleak	night,	and	though	I	sure	felt	like	I	had	given	everything	I
had,	I	never	even	had	a	chance	to	access	my	true	100	percent."
Book 2,Badwater	was	going	to	be	different.
Book 2,I	researched	day	and	night.
Book 2,"I	studied	the
course,	noted	temperature	and	elevation	variances,	and	charted	them	out."
Book 2,"I
wasn’t	just	interested	in	the	air	temperature."
Book 2,"I	drilled	down	deeper	so	I	knew
how	hot	the	pavement	would	be	on	the	hottest	Death	Valley	day	ever."
Book 2,"I	Googled
videos	of	the	race	and	watched	them	for	hours."
Book 2,"I	read	blogs	from	runners	who
completed	it,	noted	their	pitfalls	and	training	techniques."
Book 2,"I	drove	north	to	Death
Valley	and	explored	the	entire	course."
Book 2,Seeing	the	terrain	up	close	revealed	its	brutality.
Book 2,"The	first	forty-two	miles	were
dead	flat—a	run	through	God’s	blast	furnace	cranked	up	high."
Book 2,"That	would	be	my
best	opportunity	to	make	great	time,	but	to	survive	it,	I’d	need	two	crew	vehicles
to	leap	frog	one	another	and	set	up	cooling	stations	every	third	of	a	mile."
Book 2,"Thethought	of	it	thrilled	me,	but	then	again,	I	wasn’t	living	it	yet."
Book 2,"I	was	listening	to
music,	windows	down	on	a	spring	day	in	a	blooming	desert."
Book 2,"I	was	comfortable
as	hell!	It	was	all	still	a	fucked-up	fantasy!
I	marked	off	the	best	spots	to	set	up	my	cooling	stations."
Book 2,"I	noted	wherever	the
shoulder	was	wide,	and	where	stopping	would	have	to	be	avoided."
Book 2,"I	also	took
note	of	gas	stations	and	other	places	to	fill	up	on	water	and	buy	ice."
Book 2,"There
weren’t	many	of	them,	but	they	were	all	mapped."
Book 2,"After	running	the	desert
gauntlet	I’d	earn	some	relief	from	the	heat	and	pay	for	it	with	altitude."
Book 2,"The	next
stage	of	the	race	was	an	eighteen-mile	climb	to	Towne	Pass	at	4,800	feet."
Book 2,"The
sun	would	be	setting	by	then	and	after	driving	that	section,	I	pulled	over,	closed
my	eyes,	and	visualized	it	all."
Book 2,Research	is	one	part	of	preparation;	visualization	is	another.
Book 2,"Following	that
Towne	Pass	climb,	I	would	face	a	bone-crushing,	nine-mile	descent."
Book 2,"I	could	see
it	unfurl	from	the	top	of	the	pass."
Book 2,"One	thing	I	learned	from	the	Hurt	100	is	that
running	downhill	fucks	you	up	bad,	and	this	time	I’d	be	doing	it	on	asphalt."
Book 2,"I
closed	my	eyes,	opened	my	mind,	and	tried	to	feel	the	pain	in	my	quads	and
calves,	knees	and	shins."
Book 2,"I	knew	my	quads	would	bear	the	brunt	of	that	descent,
so	I	made	a	note	to	add	muscle."
Book 2,My	thighs	would	need	to	be	plated	in	steel.
Book 2,"The	eighteen-mile	climb	up	Darwin	Pass	from	mile	seventy-two	would	be	pure
hell."
Book 2,"I’d	have	to	run-walk	that	section,	but	the	sun	would	be	down,	I’d	welcome
the	chill	in	Lone	Pine,	and	from	there	I	could	make	up	some	time	because	that’s
where	the	road	flattened	out	again	before	the	final	thirteen-mile	climb	up
Whitney	Portal	Road,	to	the	finish	line	at	8,374	feet."
Book 2,"Then	again,	it’s	easy	to	write	“make	up	time”	in	your	notepad,	and	another	to
execute	it	when	you	get	there	in	real	life,	but	at	least	I	had	notes."
Book 2,"Together	with
my	annotated	maps,	they	made	up	my	Badwater	file,	which	I	studied	like	I	was
preparing	for	another	ASVAB	test."
Book 2,"I	sat	at	my	kitchen	table,	read	and	re-read
them,	and	visualized	each	mile	the	best	I	could,	but	I	also	knew	that	my	body
still	hadn’t	recovered	from	Hawaii,	which	hampered	the	other,	even	more
important	aspect	of	my	Badwater	prep:	physical	training."
Book 2,"I	was	in	dire	need	of	PT,	but	my	tendons	still	hurt	so	bad	I	couldn’t	run	for
months."
Book 2,Pages	were	flying	off	the	calendar.
Book 2,"I	needed	to	get	harder	and	become
the	strongest	runner	possible,	and	the	fact	that	I	couldn’t	train	like	I’d	hopedsapped	my	confidence."
Book 2,"Plus,	word	had	gotten	out	at	work	about	what	I	was
getting	myself	into,	and	while	I	had	some	support	from	fellow	SEALs,	I	got	my
share	of	negativity	too,	especially	when	they	found	out	I	still	couldn’t	run."
Book 2,"But
that	was	nothing	new."
Book 2,"Who	hasn’t	dreamed	up	a	possibility	for	themselves	only
to	have	friends,	colleagues,	or	family	shit	all	over	it?"
Book 2,"Most	of	us	are	motivated	as
hell	to	do	anything	to	pursue	our	dreams	until	those	around	us	remind	us	of	the
danger,	the	downside,	our	own	limitations,	and	all	the	people	before	us	that
didn’t	make	it."
Book 2,Sometimes	the	advice	comes	from	a	well-intentioned	place.
Book 2,"They
really	believe	they	are	doing	it	for	our	own	good	but	if	you	let	them,	these	same
people	will	talk	you	out	of	your	dreams,	and	your	governor	will	help	them	do	it."
Book 2,That’s	one	reason	I	invented	the	Cookie	Jar.
Book 2,"We	must	create	a	system	that
constantly	reminds	us	who	the	fuck	we	are	when	we	are	at	our	best,	because	life
is	not	going	to	pick	us	up	when	we	fall."
Book 2,"There	will	be	forks	in	the	road,	knives	in
your	fucking	back,	mountains	to	climb,	and	we	are	only	capable	of	living	up	to
the	image	we	create	for	ourselves."
Book 2,"Prepare	yourself!
We	know	life	can	be	hard,	and	yet	we	feel	sorry	for	ourselves	when	it	isn’t	fair."
Book 2,"From	this	point	forward,	accept	the	following	as	Goggins’	laws	of	nature:
	
You	will	be	made	fun	of."
Book 2,You	will	feel	insecure.
Book 2,You	may	not	be	the	best	all	the	time.
Book 2,"You	may	be	the	only	black,	white,	Asian,	Latino,	female,	male,	gay,	lesbian
or	[fill	in	your	identity	here]	in	a	given	situation."
Book 2,There	will	be	times	when	you	feel	alone.
Book 2,"Get	over	it!
Our	minds	are	fucking	strong,	they	are	our	most	powerful	weapon,	but	we	have
stopped	using	them."
Book 2,"We	have	access	to	so	many	more	resources	today	than	ever
before	and	yet	we	are	so	much	less	capable	than	those	who	came	before	us."
Book 2,"If
you	want	to	be	one	of	the	few	to	defy	those	trends	in	our	ever-softening	society,
you	will	have	to	be	willing	to	go	to	war	with	yourself	and	create	a	whole	new
identity,	which	requires	an	open	mind."
Book 2,"It’s	funny,	being	open	minded	is	oftentagged	as	new	age	or	soft."
Book 2,Fuck	that.
Book 2,"Being	open	minded	enough	to	find	a	way	is
old	school."
Book 2,It’s	what	knuckle	draggers	do.
Book 2,And	that’s	exactly	what	I	did.
Book 2,"I	borrowed	my	friend	Stokes’	bike	(he	also	graduated	in	Class	235),	and	instead
of	running	to	work,	I	rode	there	and	back	every	day."
Book 2,"There	was	an	elliptical
trainer	in	the	brand-new	SEAL	Team	Five	gym,	and	I	hit	it	once	and	sometimes
twice	a	day,	with	five	layers	of	clothes	on!	Death	Valley	heat	scared	the	shit	out
of	me,	so	I	simulated	it."
Book 2,"I	suited	up	in	three	or	four	pairs	of	sweatpants,	a	few
pull-over	sweatshirts,	a	hoodie,	and	a	fleece	hat,	all	sealed	up	in	a	Gore-Tex
shell."
Book 2,"After	two	minutes	on	the	elliptical	my	heart	rate	was	at	170,	and	I	stayed	at
it	for	two	hours	at	a	time."
Book 2,"Before	or	after	that	I’d	hop	on	the	rowing	machine	and
bang	out	30,000	meters—which	is	nearly	twenty	miles."
Book 2,"I	never	did	anything	for
ten	or	twenty	minutes."
Book 2,My	entire	mindset	was	ultra.
Book 2,It	had	to	be.
Book 2,"Afterward	I
could	be	seen	wringing	my	clothes	out,	like	I’d	just	soaked	them	in	a	river."
Book 2,"Most
of	the	guys	thought	I	was	whacked	out,	but	my	old	BUD/S	instructor,	SBG,
fucking	loved	it."
Book 2,"That	spring	I	was	tasked	as	a	land	warfare	instructor	for	SEALs	at	our	base	in
Niland,	California;	a	sorry	scrap	of	Southern	California	desert,	its	trailer	parks
rampant	with	unemployed	meth	heads."
Book 2,"Drugged-out	drifters,	who	filtered
through	the	disintegrating	settlements	on	the	Salton	Sea,	an	inland	body	of	water
sixty	miles	from	the	Mexico	border,	were	our	only	neighbors."
Book 2,"Whenever	I
passed	them	on	the	street	while	out	on	a	ten-mile	ruck,	they’d	stare	like	I	was	an
alien	that	had	materialized	into	the	real	world	from	one	of	their	speed-addled
vision	quests."
Book 2,"Then	again,	I	was	dressed	in	three	layers	of	clothes	and	a	Gore-
Tex	jacket	in	peak	hundred-degree	heat."
Book 2,"I	did	look	like	some	evil	messenger
from	the	way-out	beyond!	By	then	my	injuries	had	become	manageable	and	I
ran	ten	miles	at	a	time,	then	hiked	the	hills	around	Niland	for	hours,	weighed
down	with	a	fifty-pound	ruck."
Book 2,"The	Team	guys	I	was	training	considered	me	an	alien	being	too,	and	a	few	of
them	were	more	frightened	of	me	than	the	meth	heads."
Book 2,"They	thought	something
had	happened	to	me	on	the	battlefield	out	in	that	other	desert	where	war	wasn’t	a
game."
Book 2,What	they	didn’t	know	was	the	battlefield	for	me	was	my	own	mind.
Book 2,I	drove	back	out	to	Death	Valley	to	train	and	did	a	ten-mile	run	in	a	sauna	suit.
Book 2,"That	motherfucker	was	hot	as	balls,	but	I	had	the	hardest	race	in	the	world	ahead
of	me,	and	I’d	run	a	hundred	miles	twice."
Book 2,"I	knew	how	that	felt,	and	the	prospectof	having	to	take	on	an	additional	thirty-five	miles	petrified	me."
Book 2,"Sure,	I	talked	a
good	game,	projected	all	kinds	of	confidence,	and	raised	tens	of	thousands	of
dollars,	but	part	of	me	didn’t	know	if	I	had	what	it	took	to	finish	the	race,	so	I
had	to	invent	barbaric	PT	to	give	myself	a	chance."
Book 2,It	takes	a	lot	of	will	to	push	yourself	when	you	are	all	alone.
Book 2,"I	hated	getting	up	in
the	morning	knowing	what	the	day	held	for	me."
Book 2,"It	was	very	lonely,	but	I	knew
that	on	the	Badwater	course	I’d	reach	a	point	where	the	pain	would	become
unbearable	and	feel	insurmountable."
Book 2,"Maybe	it	would	be	at	mile	fifty	or	sixty,
maybe	later,	but	there	would	be	a	time	when	I’d	want	to	quit,	and	I	had	to	be
able	to	slay	the	one-second	decisions	in	order	to	stay	in	the	game	and	access	my
untapped	60	percent."
Book 2,"During	all	the	lonely	hours	of	heat	training,	I’d	started	to	dissect	the	quitting
mind	and	realized	that	if	I	was	going	to	perform	close	to	my	absolute	potential
and	make	the	Warrior	Foundation	proud,	I’d	have	to	do	more	than	answer	the
simple	questions	as	they	came	up."
Book 2,"I’d	have	to	stifle	the	quitting	mind	before	it
gained	any	traction	at	all."
Book 2,"Before	I	ever	asked	myself,	“Why?”	I’d	need	my
Cookie	Jar	on	recall	to	convince	me	that	despite	what	my	body	was	saying,	I	was
immune	to	suffering."
Book 2,Because	nobody	quits	an	ultra	race	or	Hell	Week	in	a	split	second.
Book 2,"People	make
the	decision	to	quit	hours	before	they	ring	that	bell,	so	I	needed	to	be	present
enough	to	recognize	when	my	body	and	mind	were	starting	to	fail	in	order	to
short	circuit	the	impulse	to	look	for	a	way	out	long	before	I	tumbled	into	that
fatal	funnel."
Book 2,"Ignoring	pain	or	blocking	out	the	truth	like	I	did	at	the	San	Diego
One	Day	would	not	work	this	time,	and	if	you	are	on	the	hunt	for	your	100
percent	you	should	catalog	your	weaknesses	and	vulnerabilities."
Book 2,"Don’t	ignore
them."
Book 2,"Be	prepared	for	them,	because	in	any	endurance	event,	in	any	high-stress
environment,	your	weaknesses	will	surface	like	bad	karma,	build	in	volume,	and
overwhelm	you."
Book 2,Unless	you	get	ahead	of	them	first.
Book 2,This	is	an	exercise	in	recognition	and	visualization.
Book 2,"You	must	recognize	what
you	are	about	to	do,	highlight	what	you	do	not	like	about	it,	and	spend	time
visualizing	each	and	every	obstacle	you	can."
Book 2,"I	was	afraid	of	the	heat,	so	in	the
run-up	to	Badwater,	I	imagined	new	and	more	medieval	self-torture	rituals
disguised	as	training	sessions	(or	maybe	it	was	the	other	way	around)."
Book 2,"I	told
myself	I	was	immune	to	suffering,	but	that	didn’t	mean	I	was	immune	to	pain."
Book 2,"Ihurt	like	everybody	else,	but	I	was	committed	to	working	my	way	around	and
through	it	so	it	would	not	derail	me."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	toed	up	to	the	line	at	Badwater
at	6	a.m.	on	July	22,	2006,	I’d	moved	my	governor	to	80	percent."
Book 2,"I’d	doubled
my	ceiling	in	six	months,	and	you	know	what	that	guaranteed	me?"
Book 2,Jack	fucking	shit.
Book 2,Badwater	has	a	staggered	start.
Book 2,"Rookies	started	at	6	a.m.,	veteran	runners	had	an
8	a.m.	start,	and	the	true	contenders	wouldn’t	take	off	until	10	a.m.,	which	put
them	in	Death	Valley	for	peak	heat."
Book 2,"Chris	Kostman	was	one	hilarious	son	of	a
bitch."
Book 2,"But	he	didn’t	know	he’d	given	one	hard	motherfucker	a	serious	tactical
advantage."
Book 2,Not	me.
Book 2,I’m	talking	about	Akos	Konya.
Book 2,"Akos	and	I	met	up	the	night	before	at	the	Furnace	Creek	Inn,	where	all	the
athletes	stayed."
Book 2,"He	was	a	first-timer	too,	and	he	looked	a	hell	of	a	lot	better	since
the	last	time	we	saw	one	another."
Book 2,"Despite	his	issues	at	the	Hurt	100	(he	finished
by	the	way,	in	35	hours	and	17	minutes),	I	knew	Akos	was	a	stud,	and	since	we
were	both	in	the	first	group	I	let	him	pace	me	through	the	desert."
Book 2,"Bad	call!
For	the	first	seventeen	miles	we	were	side	by	side,	and	we	looked	like	an	odd
couple."
Book 2,"Akos	is	a	5’7”,	122-pound	Hungarian."
Book 2,"I	was	the	biggest	man	in	the	field
at	6’1”,	195	pounds,	and	the	only	black	guy	too."
Book 2,"Akos	was	sponsored	and
dressed	in	a	colorful,	branded	getup."
Book 2,"I	wore	a	torn	grey	tank	top,	black	running
shorts,	and	streamlined	Oakley	sunglasses."
Book 2,"My	feet	and	ankles	were	wrapped	in
compression	tape	and	stuffed	into	broken-in	but	still	springy	running	shoes."
Book 2,"I
didn’t	wear	Navy	SEAL	gear	or	Warrior	Foundation	garb."
Book 2,"I	preferred	to	go
incognito."
Book 2,I	was	the	shadow	figure	filtering	into	a	new	world	of	pain.
Book 2,"During	my	first	BadwaterAlthough	Akos	set	a	fast	pace,	the	heat	didn’t	bother	me,	partly	because	it	was
early	and	because	I’d	heat	trained	so	well."
Book 2,"We	were	the	two	best	runners	in	the	6
a.m.	group	by	far,	and	when	we	passed	the	Furnace	Creek	Inn	at	8:40	a.m.,	some
of	the	runners	from	the	10	a.m.	group	were	outside,	including	Scott	Jurek,	the
defending	champion,	Badwater	record-holder,	and	an	ultra	legend."
Book 2,"He	must	have
known	we	were	making	great	time,	but	I’m	not	sure	he	realized	that	he’d	just
glimpsed	his	stiffest	competition."
Book 2,"Not	long	after,	Akos	put	some	space	between	us,	and	at	mile	twenty-six,	I	started
to	realize	that,	once	again,	I	went	out	way	too	fast."
Book 2,"I	was	dizzy	and	lightheaded,
and	I	was	dealing	with	GI	issues."
Book 2,"Translation:	I	had	to	shit	on	the	side	of	the
road."
Book 2,All	of	which	stemmed	from	the	fact	that	I	was	severely	dehydrated.
Book 2,"My
mind	spun	with	dire	prognosis	after	dire	prognosis."
Book 2,"Excuses	to	quit	piled	up	one
after	another."
Book 2,I	didn’t	listen.
Book 2,"I	responded	by	taking	care	of	my	dehydration	issue
and	pounding	more	water	than	I	wanted."
Book 2,"I	went	through	the	Stovepipe	Wells	checkpoint	at	mile	forty-two	at	1:31	p.m.,	a
full	hour	after	Akos."
Book 2,"I’d	been	on	the	race	course	for	over	seven	and	a	half	hours
and	was	almost	exclusively	walking	by	then."
Book 2,"I	was	proud	just	to	have	made	it
through	Death	Valley	on	my	feet."
Book 2,"I	took	a	break,	went	to	a	proper	bathroom,	and
changed	my	clothes."
Book 2,"My	feet	had	swollen	more	than	I’d	expected,	and	my	right
big	toe	had	been	chafing	the	side	of	the	shoe	for	hours,	so	stopping	felt	like
sweet	relief."
Book 2,"I	felt	the	bloom	of	a	blood	blister	on	the	side	of	my	left	foot,	but	I
knew	better	than	to	take	off	my	shoes."
Book 2,"Most	athletes	size	up	their	shoes	to	run
Badwater,	and	even	then,	they	cut	out	the	big	toe	side	panel	to	create	space	for
swelling	and	to	minimize	chafing."
Book 2,"I	did	not,	and	I	had	ninety	more	miles	ahead
of	me."
Book 2,"I	hiked	the	entire	eighteen-mile	climb	to	Towne	Pass	at	4,850	feet."
Book 2,"As	predicted,
the	sun	dropped	as	I	crested	the	pass,	the	air	cooled,	and	I	pulled	on	another
layer."
Book 2,"In	the	military	we	always	say	we	don’t	rise	to	the	level	of	our
expectations,	we	fall	to	the	level	of	our	training,	and	as	I	hiked	up	the	winding
highway	with	my	blister	barking,	I	fell	into	the	same	rhythm	I’d	find	on	my	long
rucks	in	the	desert	around	Niland."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	running,	but	I	kept	a	strong	pace	and
covered	a	lot	of	ground."
Book 2,"I	stuck	to	my	script,	ran	the	entire	nine-mile	descent,	and	my	quads	paid	the
price."
Book 2,So	did	my	left	foot.
Book 2,My	blister	was	growing	by	the	minute.
Book 2,I	could	feel	itverging	on	hot-air-balloon	status.
Book 2,"If	only	it	would	burst	through	my	shoe	like	an
old	cartoon,	and	continue	to	expand	until	it	carried	me	into	the	clouds	and
dropped	me	onto	the	peak	of	Mount	Whitney	itself."
Book 2,No	such	luck.
Book 2,"I	kept	walking,	and	aside	from	my	crew,	which	included,	among
others,	my	wife	(Kate	was	crew	chief)	and	mother,	I	didn’t	see	anybody	else."
Book 2,"I
was	on	an	eternal	ruck,	marching	beneath	a	black	dome	sky	glittering	with
starlight."
Book 2,"I’d	been	walking	for	so	long	I	expected	a	swarm	of	runners	to
materialize	at	any	moment,	then	leave	me	in	their	wake."
Book 2,But	nobody	showed.
Book 2,"The	only	evidence	of	life	on	planet	pain	was	the	rhythm	of	my	own	hot	breath,
the	burn	of	my	cartoon	blister,	and	the	high	beams	and	red	taillights	of	road
trippers	blazing	trails	through	the	California	night."
Book 2,"That	is,	until	the	sun	was
ready	to	rise	and	a	swarm	finally	did	arrive	at	mile	110."
Book 2,"I	was	exhausted	and	dehydrated	by	then,	glazed	in	sweat,	dirt,	and	salt,	when
horseflies	began	to	dive	bomb	me	one	at	a	time."
Book 2,"Two	became	four	which	became
ten	and	fifteen."
Book 2,"They	beat	their	wings	against	my	skin,	bit	my	thighs,	and
crawled	into	my	ears."
Book 2,"This	shit	was	biblical,	and	it	was	my	very	last	test."
Book 2,"My
crew	took	turns	swatting	flies	off	my	skin	with	a	towel."
Book 2,"I	was	in	personal	best
territory	already."
Book 2,"I’d	covered	more	than	110	miles	on	foot,	and	with	“only”
twenty-five	miles	to	go	there	was	no	fucking	way	these	devil	flies	would	stop
me."
Book 2,Would	they?
Book 2,"I	kept	marching,	and	my	crew	kept	swatting	flies,	for	the	next
eight	miles!
Since	watching	Akos	run	away	from	me	after	mile	seventeen,	I	hadn’t	seen
another	Badwater	runner	until	mile	122	when	Kate	pulled	up	alongside	me."
Book 2,"“Scott	Jurek	is	two	miles	behind	you,”	she	said."
Book 2,"We	were	more	than	twenty-six	hours	into	the	race,	and	Akos	had	already
finished,	but	the	fact	that	Jurek	was	just	now	catching	me	meant	my	time	must
have	been	pretty	damn	good."
Book 2,"I	hadn’t	run	much,	but	all	those	Niland	rucks	made
my	hiking	stride	swift	and	strong."
Book 2,"I	was	able	to	power	hike	fifteen-minute	miles,
and	got	my	nutrition	on	the	move	to	save	time."
Book 2,"After	it	was	all	over,	when	I
examined	the	splits	and	finishing	times	of	all	the	competitors,	I	realized	my
biggest	fear,	the	heat,	had	actually	helped	me."
Book 2,It	was	the	great	equalizer.
Book 2,"It	made
fast	runners	slow.With	Jurek	on	the	hunt,	I	was	inspired	to	give	it	everything	I	had	as	I	turned	onto
Whitney	Portal	Road	and	started	the	final	thirteen-mile	climb."
Book 2,"I	flashed	onto	my
pre-race	strategy	to	walk	the	slopes	and	run	the	flats	as	the	road	switched	back
like	a	snake	slithering	into	the	clouds."
Book 2,"Jurek	wasn’t	pursuing	me,	but	he	was	on
the	chase."
Book 2,"Akos	had	finished	in	twenty-five	hours	and	fifty-eight	minutes	and
Jurek	hadn’t	been	at	his	best	that	day."
Book 2,"The	clock	was	winding	down	on	his	effort
to	repeat	as	Badwater	champion,	but	he	had	the	tactical	advantage	of	knowing
Akos’	time	in	advance."
Book 2,He	also	knew	his	splits.
Book 2,"Akos	hadn’t	had	that	luxury,	and
somewhere	on	the	highway	he’d	stopped	for	a	thirty-minute	nap."
Book 2,Jurek	wasn’t	alone.
Book 2,"He	had	a	pacer,	a	formidable	runner	in	his	own	right	named
Dusty	Olson	who	nipped	at	his	heels."
Book 2,"Word	was	Olson	ran	at	least	seventy	miles
of	the	race	himself."
Book 2,"I	heard	them	approach	from	behind,	and	whenever	the	road
switched	back	I	could	see	them	below	me."
Book 2,"Finally,	at	mile	128,	on	the	steepest
part	of	the	steepest	road	in	this	entire	fucked-up	race,	they	were	right	behind	me."
Book 2,"I	stopped	running,	got	out	of	the	way,	and	cheered	them	on."
Book 2,"Jurek	was	the	fastest	ultra	runner	in	history	at	that	point,	but	his	pace	wasn’t
electric	that	late	in	the	game."
Book 2,It	was	consistent.
Book 2,"He	chopped	down	the	mighty
mountain	with	each	deliberate	step."
Book 2,"He	wore	black	running	shorts,	a	blue
sleeveless	shirt,	and	a	white	baseball	cap."
Book 2,"Behind	him,	Olson	had	his	long,
shoulder	length	hair	corralled	with	a	bandana,	otherwise	their	uniform	was
identical."
Book 2,Jurek	was	the	mule	and	Olson	was	riding	him.
Book 2,"“Come	on,	Jurker!	Come	on,	Jurker!	This	is	your	race,”	Olson	said	as	they
passed	me	up."
Book 2,"“No	one	is	better	than	you!	No	one!”	Olson	kept	talking	as	they
ran	ahead,	reminding	Jurek	that	he	had	more	to	give."
Book 2,"Jurek	obliged	and	kept
charging	up	the	mountain."
Book 2,He	left	it	all	out	on	that	unforgiving	asphalt.
Book 2,"It	was
amazing	to	watch."
Book 2,"Jurek	wound	up	winning	the	2006	edition	of	Badwater	when	he	finished	in
twenty-five	hours	and	forty-one	minutes,	seventeen	minutes	faster	than	Akos,
who	must	have	regretted	his	power	nap,	but	that	wasn’t	my	concern."
Book 2,"I	had	a	race
of	my	own	to	finish."
Book 2,"Whitney	Portal	Road	winds	up	a	parched,	exposed	rock	escarpment	for	ten
miles,	before	finding	shade	in	gathering	stands	of	cedar	and	pine."
Book 2,"Energized	by
Jurek	and	his	crew,	I	ran	most	of	the	last	seven	miles."
Book 2,"I	used	my	hips	to	push	mylegs	forward	and	every	single	step	was	agony,	but	after	thirty	hours,	eighteen
minutes,	and	fifty-four	seconds	of	running,	hiking,	sweating,	and	suffering,	I
snapped	the	tape	to	the	cheers	of	a	small	crowd."
Book 2,I’d	wanted	to	quit	thirty	times.
Book 2,"I
had	to	mentally	inch	my	way	through	135	miles,	but	ninety	runners	competed
that	day,	and	I	came	in	fifth	place."
Book 2,"Akos	and	I	after	my	second	Badwater	in	2007—I	placed	third	and	Akos	came	in	second	again
I	plodded	over	to	a	grassy	slope	in	the	woods	and	lay	back	on	a	bed	of	pineneedles	as	Kate	unlaced	my	shoes."
Book 2,That	blister	had	fully	colonized	my	left	foot.
Book 2,"It	was	so	big	it	looked	like	a	sixth	toe,	the	color	and	texture	of	cherry	bubble
gum."
Book 2,I	marveled	at	it	while	she	removed	the	compression	tape	from	my	feet.
Book 2,Then	I	staggered	to	the	stage	to	accept	my	medal	from	Kostman.
Book 2,"I’d	just	finished
one	of	the	hardest	races	on	planet	earth."
Book 2,"I’d	visualized	that	moment	ten	times	at
least	and	thought	I’d	be	elated,	but	I	wasn’t.Blistered	toe	after	Badwater
SBG’s	email	to	Kostman."
Book 2,"He	was	right:	I	did	finish	in	the	top	10	percent!
He	handed	me	my	medal,	shook	my	hand,	and	interviewed	me	for	the	crowd,	but
I	was	only	half	there."
Book 2,"While	he	spoke,	I	flashed	to	the	final	climb	and	a	pass
above	8,000	feet,	where	the	view	was	unreal."
Book 2,I	could	see	all	the	way	to	DeathValley.
Book 2,"Near	the	end	of	another	horrible	journey,	I	got	to	see	where	I	came	from."
Book 2,It	was	the	perfect	metaphor	for	my	twisted	life.
Book 2,"Once	again	I	was	broken,
destroyed	twenty	different	ways,	but	I’d	passed	another	evolution,	another
crucible,	and	my	reward	was	a	lot	more	than	a	medal	and	a	few	minutes	with
Kostman’s	microphone."
Book 2,It	was	a	whole	new	bar.
Book 2,"I	closed	my	eyes	and	saw	Jurek	and	Olson,	Akos	and	Karl	Meltzer."
Book 2,"All	of	them
had	something	I	didn’t."
Book 2,"They	understood	how	to	drain	every	last	drop	and	put
themselves	in	a	position	to	win	the	world’s	most	difficult	races,	and	it	was	time
to	seek	out	that	feeling	for	myself."
Book 2,I’d	prepared	like	a	madman.
Book 2,"I	knew	myself
and	the	terrain."
Book 2,"I	stayed	ahead	of	the	quitting	mind,	answered	the	simple
questions,	and	stayed	in	the	race,	but	there	was	more	to	be	done."
Book 2,"There	was	still
somewhere	higher	for	me	to	rise."
Book 2,"A	cool	breeze	rustled	the	trees,	dried	the	sweat
from	my	skin,	and	soothed	my	aching	bones."
Book 2,"It	whispered	in	my	ear	and	shared	a
secret	which	echoed	in	my	brain	like	a	drumbeat	that	wouldn’t	stop."
Book 2,"There	is	no	finish	line,	Goggins."
Book 2,"There	is	no	finish	line.CHALLENGE	#7
The	main	objective	here	is	to	slowly	start	to	remove	the	governor	from	your
brain."
Book 2,"First,	a	quick	reminder	of	how	this	process	works."
Book 2,"In	1999,	when	I	weighed	297
pounds,	my	first	run	was	a	quarter	mile."
Book 2,"Fast	forward	to	2007,	I	ran	205	miles	in
thirty-nine	hours,	nonstop."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	get	there	overnight,	and	I	don’t	expect	you	to
either."
Book 2,Your	job	is	to	push	past	your	normal	stopping	point.
Book 2,"Whether	you	are	running	on	a	treadmill	or	doing	a	set	of	push-ups,	get	to	the
point	where	you	are	so	tired	and	in	pain	that	your	mind	is	begging	you	to	stop."
Book 2,Then	push	just	5	to	10	percent	further.
Book 2,"If	the	most	push-ups	you	have	ever	done
is	one	hundred	in	a	workout,	do	105	or	110."
Book 2,"If	you	normally	run	thirty	miles
each	week,	run	10	percent	more	next	week."
Book 2,"This	gradual	ramp-up	will	help	prevent	injury	and	allow	your	body	and	mind	to
slowly	adapt	to	your	new	workload."
Book 2,"It	also	resets	your	baseline,	which	is
important	because	you’re	about	to	increase	your	workload	another	5	to	10
percent	the	following	week,	and	the	week	after	that."
Book 2,"There	is	so	much	pain	and	suffering	involved	in	physical	challenges	that	it’s	the
best	training	to	take	command	of	your	inner	dialogue,	and	the	newfound	mental
strength	and	confidence	you	gain	by	continuing	to	push	yourself	physically	will
carry	over	to	other	aspects	in	your	life."
Book 2,"You	will	realize	that	if	you	were
underperforming	in	your	physical	challenges,	there	is	a	good	chance	you	are
underperforming	at	school	and	work	too."
Book 2,The	bottom	line	is	that	life	is	one	big	mind	game.
Book 2,"The	only	person	you	are
playing	against	is	yourself."
Book 2,"Stick	with	this	process	and	soon	what	you	thought
was	impossible	will	be	something	you	do	every	fucking	day	of	your	life."
Book 2,"I	want
to	hear	your	stories."
Book 2,Post	on	social.
Book 2,"Hashtags:	#canthurtme	#The40PercentRule
#dontgetcomfortable.CHAPTER	EIGHT
8."
Book 2,"TALENT	NOT	REQUIRED
The	night	before	the	first	long-distance	triathlon	in	my	life,	I	stood	with	my
mother	on	the	deck	of	a	sprawling,	seven-million-dollar	beach	house	in	Kona
watching	the	moonlight	play	on	the	water."
Book 2,"Most	people	know	Kona,	a	gorgeous
town	on	the	west	coast	of	the	island	of	Hawaii,	and	triathlons	in	general,	thanks
to	the	Ironman	World	Championships."
Book 2,"Although	there	are	far	more	Olympic
distance	and	shorter	sprint	triathlons	held	around	the	world	than	there	are
Ironman	events,	it	was	the	original	Ironman	in	Kona	that	placed	the	sport	on	the
international	radar."
Book 2,"It	starts	with	a	2.4-mile	swim	followed	by	a	112-mile	bike
ride,	and	closes	with	a	marathon	run."
Book 2,"Add	to	that	stiff	and	shifting	winds	and
blistering	heat	corridors	reflected	by	harsh	lava	fields,	and	the	race	reduces	most
competitors	to	open	blisters	of	raw	anguish,	but	I	wasn’t	here	for	that."
Book 2,"I	came	to
Kona	to	compete	in	a	less	celebrated	form	of	even	more	intense	masochism."
Book 2,"I
was	there	to	compete	for	the	title	of	Ultraman."
Book 2,"Over	the	next	three	days	I	would	swim	6.2	miles,	ride	261	miles,	and	run	a
double	marathon,	covering	the	entire	perimeter	of	the	Big	Island	of	Hawaii."
Book 2,"Once	again,	I	was	raising	money	for	the	Special	Operations	Warrior	Foundation,
and	because	I’d	been	written	up	and	interviewed	on	camera	after	Badwater,	I
was	invited	by	a	multi-millionaire	I’d	never	met	to	stay	in	his	absurd	palace	on
the	sand	in	the	run-up	to	the	Ultraman	World	Championships	in	November
2006."
Book 2,"It	was	a	generous	gesture,	but	I	was	so	focused	on	becoming	the	very	best
version	of	myself	his	glitz	didn’t	impress	me."
Book 2,"In	my	mind,	I	still	hadn’t	achieved
shit."
Book 2,"If	anything,	staying	in	his	house	only	inflated	the	chip	on	my	shoulder."
Book 2,"He
would	never	have	invited	my	wanna-be-thug	ass	to	come	chill	with	him	in	Kona
luxury	back	in	the	day."
Book 2,"He	only	reached	out	because	I’d	become	somebody	a
rich	guy	like	him	wanted	to	know."
Book 2,"Still,	I	appreciated	being	able	to	show	my
mom	a	better	life,	and	whenever	I	was	offered	a	taste,	I	invited	her	to	experience
it	with	me."
Book 2,"She’d	swallowed	more	pain	than	anyone	I’d	ever	known,	and	I
wanted	to	remind	her	that	we’d	climbed	out	of	that	gutter,	while	I	kept	my	owngaze	locked	at	sewer	level."
Book 2,"We	didn’t	live	in	that	$7	a	month	place	in	Brazil
anymore,	but	I	was	still	paying	rent	on	that	motherfucker,	and	will	be	for	the	rest
of	my	life."
Book 2,"The	race	launched	from	the	beach	beside	the	pier	in	downtown	Kona—the	same
start	line	as	the	Ironman	World	Championships,	but	there	wasn’t	much	of	a
crowd	for	our	race."
Book 2,"There	were	only	thirty	athletes	in	the	entire	field	compared
to	over	1,200	in	the	Ironman!	It	was	such	a	small	group	I	could	look	every	one
of	my	competitors	in	the	eye	and	size	them	up,	which	is	how	I	noticed	the
hardest	man	on	the	beach."
Book 2,"I	never	did	catch	his	name,	but	I’ll	always	remember
him	because	he	was	in	a	wheelchair."
Book 2,Talk	about	heart.
Book 2,"That	man	had	a	presence
beyond	his	stature."
Book 2,"He	was	fucking	immense!
Ever	since	I’d	started	up	in	BUD/S,	I’d	been	in	search	of	people	like	that."
Book 2,"Men
and	women	with	an	uncommon	way	of	thinking."
Book 2,"One	thing	that	surprised	me
about	military	special	operations	was	that	some	of	the	guys	lived	so	mainstream."
Book 2,"They	weren’t	trying	to	push	themselves	every	day	of	their	lives,	and	I	wanted	to
be	around	people	who	thought	and	trained	uncommon	24/7,	not	just	when	duty
called."
Book 2,"That	man	had	every	excuse	in	the	world	to	be	at	home,	but	he	was	ready
to	do	one	of	the	hardest	stage	races	in	the	world,	something	99.9	percent	of	the
public	wouldn’t	even	consider,	and	with	just	his	two	arms!	To	me,	he	was	what
ultra	racing	was	all	about,	and	its	why	after	Badwater	I’d	become	hooked	on	this
world."
Book 2,Talent	wasn’t	required	for	this	sport.
Book 2,"It	was	all	about	heart	and	hard	work,
and	it	delivered	relentless	challenge	after	relentless	challenge,	always	demanding
more."
Book 2,But	that	doesn’t	mean	I	was	well-prepared	for	this	race.
Book 2,I	still	didn’t	own	a	bike.
Book 2,I	borrowed	one	three	weeks	earlier	from	another	friend.
Book 2,"It	was	a	Griffin,	an	uber-
high-end	bicycle	custom	made	for	my	friend	who	was	even	bigger	than	I	was."
Book 2,"I
borrowed	his	clip-in	shoes	too,	which	were	just	shy	of	clown-sized."
Book 2,"I	filled	the
empty	space	with	thick	socks	and	compression	tape,	and	didn’t	take	the	time	to
learn	bike	mechanics	before	leaving	for	Kona."
Book 2,"Changing	tires,	fixing	chains	and
spokes,	all	the	stuff	I	know	how	to	do	now,	I	hadn’t	learned	yet."
Book 2,"I	just	borrowed
the	bike	and	logged	over	1,000	miles	in	the	three	weeks	prior	to	Ultraman."
Book 2,"I’d
wake	up	at	4	a.m.	and	get	one	hundred-mile	rides	in	before	work."
Book 2,"On	weekends
I’d	ride	125	miles,	get	off	the	bike	and	run	a	marathon,	but	I	only	did	six	trainingswims,	just	two	in	the	open	water,	and	in	the	ultra	octagon	all	your	weaknesses
are	revealed."
Book 2,"The	ten-kilometer	swim	should	have	taken	me	about	two	and	a	half	hours	to
complete,	but	it	took	me	over	three,	and	it	hurt."
Book 2,"I	was	dressed	in	a	sleeveless
wetsuit	for	buoyancy,	but	it	was	too	tight	under	my	arms,	and	within	thirty
minutes	my	armpits	began	to	chafe."
Book 2,"An	hour	later	the	salty	edge	of	my	suit	had
become	sandpaper	that	ripped	my	skin	with	every	stroke."
Book 2,"I	switched	from
freestyle	to	side	stroke	and	back	again,	desperate	for	comfort	that	never	came."
Book 2,Every	revolution	of	my	arms	cut	my	skin	raw	and	bloody	on	both	sides.
Book 2,"Coming	out	of	the	water	at	Ultraman
Plus,	the	sea	was	choppy	as	hell."
Book 2,"I	drank	sea	water,	my	stomach	flipped	and
flopped	like	a	fish	suffocating	in	fresh	air,	and	I	puked	a	half	dozen	times	at
least."
Book 2,"Because	of	the	pain,	my	poor	mechanics,	and	the	strong	current,	I	swam	a
meandering	line	that	stretched	to	seven	and	a	half	miles."
Book 2,"All	of	that	in	order	to
clear	what	was	supposed	to	be	a	6.2-mile	swim."
Book 2,"My	legs	were	jelly	when	I
staggered	to	shore,	and	my	vision	rocked	like	a	teeter	totter	during	an
earthquake."
Book 2,"I	had	to	lie	down,	then	crawl	behind	the	bathrooms,	where	I	vomited
again."
Book 2,"Other	swimmers	gathered	in	the	transition	area,	hopped	into	their	saddles,
and	pedaled	off	into	the	lava	fields	in	a	blink."
Book 2,"We	still	had	a	ninety-mile	bike
ride	to	knock	off	before	the	day	was	done,	and	they	were	getting	after	it	while	I
was	still	on	my	knees."
Book 2,"Right	on	time,	those	simple	questions	bubbled	to	the
surface."
Book 2,Why	the	fuck	am	I	even	out	here?
Book 2,"I’m	not	a	triathlete!I’m	chafed	to	hell,	sick	as	fuck,	and	the	first	part	of	the	ride	is	all	uphill!
Why	do	you	keep	doing	this	to	yourself,	Goggins?"
Book 2,"I	sounded	like	a	whiny	bitch,	but	I	knew	finding	some	comfort	would	help	me
hem	my	vagina,	so	I	paid	no	attention	to	the	other	athletes	who	eased	through
their	transition."
Book 2,"I	had	to	focus	on	getting	my	legs	under	me	and	slowing	my
spun-out	mind."
Book 2,"First	I	got	some	food	down,	a	little	at	a	time."
Book 2,"Then	I	treated	the
cuts	under	my	arms."
Book 2,Most	triathletes	don’t	change	their	clothes.
Book 2,I	did.
Book 2,"I	slipped
on	some	comfortable	bike	shorts	and	a	lycra	shirt,	and	fifteen	minutes	later	I	was
upright,	in	the	saddle,	and	climbing	into	the	lava	fields."
Book 2,"For	the	first	twenty
minutes	I	was	still	nauseous."
Book 2,"I	pedaled	and	puked,	replenished	my	fluids,	and
puked	again."
Book 2,"Through	it	all,	I	gave	myself	one	job:	stay	in	the	fight!	Stay	in	it
long	enough	to	find	a	foothold."
Book 2,"Ten	miles	later,	as	the	road	rose	onto	the	shoulders	of	a	giant	volcano	and	the
incline	increased,	I	shook	off	my	sea	legs	and	found	momentum."
Book 2,"Riders
appeared	ahead	like	bogeys	on	a	radar,	and	I	picked	them	off,	one	by	one."
Book 2,Victory	was	a	cure-all.
Book 2,"Each	time	I	passed	another	motherfucker	I	got	less	and
less	sick."
Book 2,"I	was	in	fourteenth	place	when	I	saddled	up,	but	by	the	time	I
approached	the	end	of	that	ninety-mile	leg	there	was	only	one	man	in	front	of
me."
Book 2,"Gary	Wang,	the	favorite	in	the	race."
Book 2,"As	I	hammered	toward	the	finish	line	I	could	see	a	reporter	and	photographer
from	Triathlete	magazine	interviewing	him."
Book 2,"None	of	them	expected	to	see	my
black	ass,	and	they	all	watched	me	carefully."
Book 2,"During	the	four	months	since
Badwater,	I’d	often	dreamt	of	being	in	position	to	win	an	ultra	race,	and	as	I
coasted	past	Gary	and	those	reporters,	I	knew	the	moment	had	arrived,	and	my
expectations	were	intergalactic."
Book 2,"The	following	morning,	we	lined	up	for	the	second	stage,	a	171-mile	bike	ride
through	the	mountains	and	back	toward	the	west	coast."
Book 2,"Gary	Wang	had	a	buddy
in	the	race,	Jeff	Landauer,	aka	the	Land	Shark,	and	those	two	rode	together."
Book 2,Gary	had	done	the	race	before	and	knew	the	terrain.
Book 2,"I	didn’t,	and	by	mile	one
hundred,	I	was	roughly	six	minutes	off	the	lead."
Book 2,"As	usual,	my	mother	and	Kate	were	my	two-headed	support	crew."
Book 2,"They	handedme	replacement	water	bottles,	packets	of	GU,	and	protein	drinks	from	the	side	of
the	road,	which	I	consumed	in	motion	to	keep	my	glycogen	and	electrolyte
levels	up."
Book 2,"I’d	become	much	more	scientific	about	my	nutrition	since	that
Myoplex	and	Ritz	cracker	meltdown	in	San	Diego,	and	with	the	biggest	climb	of
the	day	looming	into	view	I	needed	to	be	ready	to	roar."
Book 2,"On	a	bicycle,	mountains
produce	pain,	and	pain	was	my	business."
Book 2,"As	the	road	peaked	in	pitch,	I	put	my
head	down	and	hammered	as	hard	as	I	could."
Book 2,"My	lungs	heaved	until	they	were
flipped	inside	out	and	back	again."
Book 2,My	heart	was	a	pounding	bass	line.
Book 2,"When	I
crested	the	pass,	my	mom	pulled	up	alongside	me	and	hollered,	“David,	you	are
two	minutes	off	the	lead!”
Roger	that!
I	curled	into	an	aerodynamic	crouch	and	shot	downhill	at	over	40	mph."
Book 2,"My
borrowed	Griffin	was	equipped	with	aero	bars	and	I	leaned	over	them,	focusing
only	on	the	white	dotted	line	and	my	perfect	form."
Book 2,"When	the	road	leveled	off	I
went	all	out	and	kept	my	pace	up	around	27	mph."
Book 2,"I	had	a	Land	Shark	and	his
buddy	on	an	industrial-sized	hook,	and	was	reeling	them	all	the	way	in."
Book 2,Until	my	front	tire	blew.
Book 2,"Before	I	had	time	to	react,	I	was	off	the	bike,	somersaulting	over	the	handlebars
into	space."
Book 2,"I	could	see	it	happening	in	slow	motion,	but	time	sped	back	up	when
I	crash	landed	on	my	right	side	and	my	shoulder	crumpled	with	blunt	force."
Book 2,"The
side	of	my	face	skidded	the	asphalt	until	I	stopped	moving,	and	I	rolled	onto	my
back	in	shock."
Book 2,"My	mother	slammed	on	her	brakes,	leapt	from	the	car,	and	rushed
over."
Book 2,"I	was	bleeding	in	five	places,	but	nothing	felt	broken."
Book 2,"Except	my	helmet,
which	was	cracked	in	two,	my	sunglasses,	which	were	shattered,	and	my	bicycle."
Book 2,"I’d	run	over	a	bolt	that	pierced	the	tire,	tube,	and	rim."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	pay	attention	to
my	road	rash,	the	pain	in	my	shoulder,	or	the	blood	dribbling	down	my	elbow
and	cheek."
Book 2,All	I	thought	about	was	that	bicycle.
Book 2,"Once	again,	I	was
underprepared!	I	had	no	spare	parts	and	didn’t	have	any	clue	how	to	change	a
tube	or	a	tire."
Book 2,"I	had	rented	a	back-up	bicycle	which	was	in	my	mom’s	rental	car,
but	it	was	a	heavy,	slow	piece	of	shit	compared	to	that	Griffin."
Book 2,"It	didn’t	even
have	clip	in	pedals,	so	I	called	for	the	official	race	mechanics	to	assess	the
Griffin."
Book 2,"As	we	waited,	seconds	piled	up	into	twenty	precious	minutes	and	when
mechanics	arrived,	they	didn’t	have	supplies	to	fix	my	front	wheel	either,	so	Ihopped	on	my	clunky	back-up	and	kept	rolling."
Book 2,I	tried	not	to	think	of	bad	luck	and	missed	opportunities.
Book 2,"I	needed	to	finish	strong
and	get	myself	within	striking	distance	by	the	end	of	the	day,	because	day	three
would	bring	a	double	marathon,	and	I	was	convinced	that	I	was	the	best	runner
in	the	field."
Book 2,"Sixteen	miles	from	the	finish	line,	the	bike	mechanic	tracked	me
down."
Book 2,"He’d	repaired	my	Griffin!	I	switched	out	my	hardware	for	the	second	time
and	made	up	eight	minutes	on	the	leaders,	finishing	the	day	in	third	place,
twenty-two	minutes	off	the	lead."
Book 2,I	crafted	a	simple	strategy	for	day	three.
Book 2,"Go	out	hard	and	build	up	a	fat	cushion
over	Gary	and	the	Land	Shark	so	that	when	I	hit	the	inevitable	wall,	I’d	have
enough	distance	to	maintain	the	overall	lead	all	the	way	to	the	finish	line."
Book 2,"In
other	words,	I	didn’t	have	any	strategy	at	all."
Book 2,I	began	my	run	at	Boston	Marathon	qualifying	pace.
Book 2,"I	pushed	hard	because	I
wanted	my	competitors	to	hear	my	splits	and	forfeit	their	souls	as	I	built	that	big
lead	I’d	anticipated."
Book 2,I	knew	I	would	blow	up	somewhere.
Book 2,That’s	ultra	life.
Book 2,"I	just
hoped	it	would	happen	late	enough	in	the	race	that	Gary	and	the	Land	Shark
would	be	content	to	race	one	another	for	second	and	give	up	all	hope	of	winning
the	overall	title."
Book 2,Didn’t	happen	quite	like	that.
Book 2,At	mile	thirty-five	I	was	already	in	agony	and	walking	more	than	I	was	running.
Book 2,"By	mile	forty,	I	watched	both	enemy	vehicles	pull	up	so	their	crew	chiefs	could
peep	my	form."
Book 2,"I	was	showing	a	ton	of	weakness,	which	gave	Gary	and	the	Land
Shark	ammunition."
Book 2,The	miles	mounted	too	slowly.
Book 2,I	hemorrhaged	time.
Book 2,"Luckily,
by	mile	forty-five,	Gary	had	blown	up	too,	but	the	Land	Shark	was	rock	solid,
still	on	my	ass,	and	I	didn’t	have	anything	left	to	fight	him	off."
Book 2,"Instead,	as	I
suffered	and	staggered	toward	downtown	Kona,	my	lead	evaporated."
Book 2,"In	the	end,	the	Land	Shark	taught	me	a	vital	lesson."
Book 2,"From	day	one,	he	had	run	his
own	race."
Book 2,My	early	burst	on	day	three	didn’t	faze	him.
Book 2,"He	welcomed	it	as	the	ill-
conceived	strategy	that	it	was,	focused	on	his	own	pace,	waited	me	out,	and	took
my	soul."
Book 2,"I	was	the	first	athlete	to	cross	the	finish	line	of	the	Ultraman	that	year,
but	as	far	as	the	clock	was	concerned	I	was	no	champion."
Book 2,"While	I	came	in	first
place	on	the	run,	I	lost	the	overall	race	by	ten	minutes	and	took	second	place.The	Land	Shark	was	crowned	Ultraman!
I	watched	him	celebrate	knowing	exactly	how	I’d	wasted	an	opportunity	to	win."
Book 2,I’d	lost	my	vantage	point.
Book 2,"I’d	never	evaluated	the	race	strategically	and	didn’t
have	any	backstops	in	place."
Book 2,"Backstops	are	a	versatile	tool	that	I	employ	in	all
facets	of	my	life."
Book 2,"I	was	lead	navigator	when	I	operated	in	Iraq	with	the	SEAL
Teams,	and	“backstop”	is	a	navigation	term."
Book 2,It’s	the	mark	I	made	on	my	map.
Book 2,An	alert	that	we’d	missed	a	turn	or	veered	off	course.
Book 2,"Let’s	say	you’re	navigating	through	the	woods	and	you	have	to	go	one	click
toward	a	ridgeline,	then	make	a	turn."
Book 2,"In	the	military,	we	would	do	a	map	study
ahead	of	time	and	mark	that	turn	on	our	maps,	and	another	point	about	200
meters	past	that	turn,	and	a	third	an	additional	150	meters	past	the	second	mark."
Book 2,Those	last	two	marks	are	your	backstops.
Book 2,"Typically,	I	used	terrain	features,	like
roads,	creeks,	a	giant	cliff	in	the	countryside,	or	landmark	buildings	in	an	urban
setting,	so	that	when	we	hit	them	I	knew	we’d	gone	off	course."
Book 2,"That’s	what
backstops	are	for,	to	tell	you	to	turn	around,	reassess,	and	take	an	alternative
route	to	accomplish	the	same	mission."
Book 2,"I	never	left	our	base	in	Iraq	without
having	three	exit	strategies."
Book 2,"A	primary	route	and	two	others,	pinned	to
backstops,	we	could	fall	back	to	if	our	main	route	became	compromised."
Book 2,"On	day	three	of	Ultraman,	I	tried	to	win	with	sheer	will."
Book 2,"I	was	all	motor,	no
intellect."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	evaluate	my	condition,	respect	my	opponents’	heart,	or	manage
the	clock	well	enough."
Book 2,"I	had	no	primary	strategy,	let	alone	alternative	avenues	to
victory,	and	therefore	I	had	no	idea	where	to	employ	backstops."
Book 2,"In	retrospect	I
should	have	paid	more	attention	to	my	own	clock,	and	my	backstops	should	have
been	placed	on	my	split	times."
Book 2,"When	I	saw	how	fast	I	was	running	that	first
marathon,	I	should	have	been	alarmed	and	eased	off	the	gas."
Book 2,"A	slower	first
marathon	may	have	left	me	with	enough	energy	to	drop	the	hammer	once	we
were	back	in	the	lava	fields	on	the	Ironman	course,	heading	toward	the	finish
line."
Book 2,"That’s	when	you	take	someone’s	soul—at	the	end	of	a	race,	not	at	the
beginning."
Book 2,"I’d	raced	hard,	but	if	I’d	run	smarter	and	handled	the	bike	situation
better,	I	would	have	given	myself	a	better	chance	to	win."
Book 2,"Still,	coming	in	second	place	at	Ultraman	was	no	disaster."
Book 2,"I	raised	good	money
for	families	in	need	and	booked	more	positive	ink	for	the	SEALs	in	Triathlete
and	Competitor	magazines."
Book 2,Navy	brass	took	notice.
Book 2,"One	morning,	I	was	called
into	a	meeting	with	Admiral	Ed	Winters,	a	two-star	Admiral	and	the	top	man	atNaval	Special	Warfare	Command."
Book 2,"When	you’re	an	enlisted	guy	and	hear	an
Admiral	wants	a	word,	your	ass	sort	of	puckers	up."
Book 2,"He	wasn’t	supposed	to	seek
me	out."
Book 2,"There	was	a	chain	of	command	in	place	specifically	to	prevent
conversations	between	Rear	Admirals	and	enlisted	men	like	me."
Book 2,"Without	any
warning	that	was	all	out	the	window,	and	I	had	a	feeling	it	was	my	own	fault."
Book 2,"Thanks	to	the	positive	media	I’d	generated,	I	had	received	orders	to	join	the
recruitment	division	in	2007,	and	by	the	time	I	was	ordered	into	the	Admiral’s
office	I’d	done	plenty	of	public	speaking	on	behalf	of	the	Navy	SEALs.	But	I
was	different	than	most	of	the	other	recruiters."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	just	parrot	the	Navy’s
script."
Book 2,"I	always	included	my	own	life	story,	off	the	cuff."
Book 2,"As	I	waited	outside	the
Admiral’s	office	I	closed	my	eyes	and	flipped	through	memory	files,	searching
for	when	and	how	I’d	overstepped	and	embarrassed	the	SEALs.	I	was	the	picture
of	tension,	sitting	stiff	and	alert,	sweating	through	my	uniform	when	he	opened
the	door	to	his	office."
Book 2,"“Goggins,”	he	said,	“good	to	see	you,	come	on	in.”	I	opened	my	eyes,	followed
him	inside,	and	stood	straight	as	an	arrow,	locked	at	attention."
Book 2,"“Sit	down,”	he
said	with	a	smile,	gesturing	to	a	chair	facing	his	desk."
Book 2,"I	sat,	but	maintained	my
posture	and	avoided	all	eye	contact."
Book 2,Admiral	Winters	sized	me	up.
Book 2,"He	was	in	his	late	fifties,	and	though	he	appeared	relaxed,	he	maintained	perfect
posture."
Book 2,To	become	an	Admiral	is	to	rise	through	the	ranks	of	tens	of	thousands.
Book 2,"He’d	been	a	SEAL	since	1981,	was	an	Operations	Officer	at	DEVGRU	(Naval
Special	Warfare	Development	Group),	and	a	Commander	in	Afghanistan	and
Iraq."
Book 2,"At	each	stop	he	stood	taller	than	the	rest,	and	was	among	the	strongest,
smartest,	shrewdest,	and	most	charismatic	men	the	Navy	had	ever	seen."
Book 2,"He	also
fit	a	certain	standard."
Book 2,"Admiral	Winters	was	the	ultimate	insider,	and	I	was	as
outside	the	box	as	you	could	get	in	the	United	States	Navy."
Book 2,"“Hey,	relax,”	he	said,	“you	aren’t	in	any	trouble."
Book 2,"You’re	doing	a	great	job	in
recruiting.”	He	gestured	to	a	file	on	his	otherwise	immaculate	desk."
Book 2,"It	was	filled
with	some	of	my	clips."
Book 2,“You’re	representing	us	really	well.
Book 2,"But	there’s	some
men	out	there	we	need	to	do	a	better	job	of	reaching	out	to,	and	I’m	hoping	you
can	help.”
That’s	when	it	finally	hit	me."
Book 2,"A	two-star	Admiral	needed	my	help.The	trouble	we	faced	as	an	organization,	he	said,	was	that	we	were	terrible	at
recruiting	African	Americans	into	the	SEAL	Teams."
Book 2,I	knew	that	already.
Book 2,"Black
people	made	up	only	1	percent	of	all	special	forces,	even	though	we	are	13
percent	of	the	general	population."
Book 2,"I	was	just	the	thirty-sixth	African	American
ever	to	graduate	BUD/S,	and	one	of	the	reasons	for	that	was	we	weren’t	hitting
the	best	places	to	recruit	black	men	into	the	SEAL	teams,	and	we	didn’t	have	the
right	recruiters	either."
Book 2,"The	military	likes	to	think	of	itself	as	a	pure	meritocracy
(it	isn’t),	which	is	why	for	decades	this	issue	was	ignored."
Book 2,"I	called	Admiral
Winters	recently,	and	he	had	this	to	say	about	the	problem,	which	was	originally
flagged	by	the	Pentagon	during	the	second	Bush	administration	and	sent	to	the
Admiral’s	desk	to	fix."
Book 2,"“We	were	missing	an	opportunity	to	get	great	athletes	into	the	teams	and	make
the	teams	better,”	he	said,	“and	we	had	places	we	needed	to	send	people	where,
if	they	looked	like	me,	they	would	be	compromised.”
In	Iraq,	Admiral	Winters	made	his	name	building	elite	counter	terrorism	forces."
Book 2,"That’s	one	of	the	primary	missions	in	special	forces:	to	train	allied	military	units
so	they	can	control	social	cancers	like	terrorism	and	drug	trafficking	and
maintain	stability	within	borders."
Book 2,"By	2007,	Al	Qaeda	had	made	inroads	into
Africa,	allied	with	existing	extremist	networks	including	Boko	Haram	and	al
Shabaab,	and	there	was	talk	of	building	up	counterterrorism	forces	in	Somalia,
Chad,	Nigeria,	Mali,	Cameroon,	Burkina	Faso,	and	Niger."
Book 2,"Our	operations	in
Niger	made	international	news	in	2018	when	four	American	special	operations
soldiers	were	killed	in	an	ambush,	drawing	public	scrutiny	to	the	mission."
Book 2,"But
back	in	2007,	almost	nobody	knew	we	were	about	to	get	involved	in	West
Africa,	or	that	we	lacked	the	personnel	to	get	it	done."
Book 2,"As	I	sat	in	his	office,	what
I	heard	was	the	time	had	finally	come	when	we	needed	black	people	in	special
forces	and	our	military	leaders	were	clueless	as	to	how	to	meet	that	need	and
entice	more	of	us	into	the	fold."
Book 2,It	was	all	new	information	to	me.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	anything	about	the	African
threat."
Book 2,The	only	hostile	terrain	I	knew	about	was	in	Afghanistan	and	Iraq.
Book 2,"That
is,	until	Admiral	Winters	dropped	a	whole	new	detail	on	me,	and	the	military’s
problem	officially	became	my	problem."
Book 2,"I’d	report	to	my	Captain	and	the
Admiral,	he	said,	and	hit	the	road,	visiting	ten	to	twelve	cities	at	a	time,	with	a
goal	of	spiking	recruiting	numbers	in	the	POC	(people	of	color)	category.We	made	the	first	stop	on	this	new	mission	together."
Book 2,"It	was	at	Howard
University,	in	Washington	D.C.,	probably	the	best	known	historically	black
university	in	America."
Book 2,"We’d	dropped	in	to	speak	to	the	football	team,	and
though	I	knew	almost	nothing	about	historically	black	colleges	and	universities,
I	knew	students	who	attended	them	aren’t	usually	the	type	to	think	of	the
military	as	an	optimal	career	choice."
Book 2,"Thanks	to	our	country’s	history	and	the
rampant	racism	that	continues	to	this	day,	black	political	thought	trends	left	of
center	at	these	institutions,	and	if	you’re	recruiting	for	the	Navy	SEALs,	there
are	definitely	better	choices	than	the	Howard	University	practice	field	to	find	a
willing	ear."
Book 2,"But	this	new	focus	required	work	in	hostile	territory,	not	mass
enthusiasm."
Book 2,We	were	looking	for	one	or	two	great	men	at	each	stop.
Book 2,"The	Admiral	and	I	walked	onto	the	field,	dressed	in	uniform,	and	I	noted
suspicion	and	disregard	in	the	eyes	of	our	audience."
Book 2,"Admiral	Winters	had
planned	to	introduce	me,	but	our	icy	reception	told	me	we	had	to	go	another
way."
Book 2,"“You	were	shy	at	first,”	Admiral	Winters	remembered,	“but	when	it	was	time	to
speak,	you	looked	at	me	and	said,	‘I	got	this,	sir.’”
I	launched	right	into	my	life	story."
Book 2,"I	told	those	athletes	what	I’ve	already	told
you,	and	said	we	were	looking	for	guys	with	heart."
Book 2,"Men	who	knew	it	was	going
to	be	hard	tomorrow	and	the	day	after	that	and	welcomed	every	challenge."
Book 2,"Men
who	wanted	to	become	better	athletes,	and	smarter	and	more	capable	in	all
aspects	of	their	life."
Book 2,"We	wanted	guys	who	craved	honor	and	purpose	and	were
open	minded	enough	to	face	their	deepest	fears."
Book 2,"“By	the	time	you	were	done	you	could	have	heard	a	pin	drop,”	Admiral	Winters
recalled."
Book 2,"From	then	on,	I	was	given	command	of	my	own	schedule	and	budget	and	leeway
to	operate,	as	long	as	I	hit	certain	recruitment	thresholds."
Book 2,"I	had	to	come	up	with
my	own	material	and	knew	that	most	people	didn’t	think	they	could	ever	become
a	Navy	SEAL,	so	I	broadened	the	message."
Book 2,"I	wanted	everyone	who	heard	me	out
to	know	that	even	if	they	didn’t	walk	in	our	direction	they	could	still	become
more	than	they	ever	dreamed."
Book 2,"I	made	sure	to	cover	my	life	in	its	entirety	so	if
anyone	had	any	excuse,	my	story	would	void	all	that	out."
Book 2,"My	main	drive	was	to
deliver	hope	that	with	or	without	the	military	anybody	could	change	their	life,	solong	as	they	kept	an	open	mind,	abandoned	the	path	of	least	resistance,	and
sought	out	the	difficult	and	most	challenging	tasks	they	could	find."
Book 2,"I	was	mining
for	diamonds	in	the	rough	like	me."
Book 2,"From	2007–2009,	I	was	on	the	road	for	250	days	a	year	and	spoke	to	500,000
people	at	high	schools	and	universities."
Book 2,"I	spoke	at	inner	city	high	schools	in
tough	neighborhoods,	at	dozens	of	historically	black	colleges	and	universities,
and	at	schools	with	all	cultures,	shapes,	and	shades	well	represented."
Book 2,"I’d	come	a
long	way	from	fourth	grade,	when	I	couldn’t	stand	up	in	front	of	a	class	of
twenty	kids	and	say	my	own	name	without	stuttering."
Book 2,"Teenagers	are	walking,	talking	bullshit	detectors,	but	the	kids	who	heard	me
speak	bought	into	my	message	because	everywhere	I	stopped,	I	also	ran	an	ultra
race	and	rolled	my	training	runs	and	races	into	my	overall	recruitment	strategy."
Book 2,"I’d	usually	land	in	their	town	midweek,	make	my	speeches,	then	run	a	race	on
Saturday	and	Sunday."
Book 2,"In	one	stretch	in	2007,	I	ran	an	ultra	almost	every
weekend."
Book 2,"There	were	fifty-mile	races,	100-kilometer	races,	100-mile	races,	and
longer	ones	too."
Book 2,"I	was	all	about	spreading	the	Navy	SEAL	legend	that	I	loved,
and	wanted	to	be	true	and	living	our	ethos."
Book 2,"Essentially,	I	had	two	full-time	jobs."
Book 2,"My	schedule	was	jammed	full,	and	while	I
know	that	having	the	flexibility	to	manage	my	own	time	contributed	to	my
ability	to	train	for	and	compete	on	the	ultra	circuit,	I	still	put	in	fifty	hours	a
week	at	work,	clocking	in	every	day	from	about	7:30	a.m.	to	5:30	p.m.	My
training	hours	came	in	addition	to,	not	instead	of,	my	work	commitments."
Book 2,"I	appeared	at	upwards	of	forty-five	schools	every	month,	and	after	each
appearance	I	had	to	file	an	After	Action	Report	(AAR),	detailing	how	many
separate	events	(an	auditorium	speech,	a	workout,	etc.)	I	organized,	how	many
kids	I	spoke	to,	and	how	many	of	those	were	actually	interested."
Book 2,"These	AARs
went	directly	to	my	Captain	and	the	Admiral."
Book 2,I	learned	quickly	that	I	was	my	own	best	prop.
Book 2,"Sometimes	I’d	dress	in	a	SEAL	t-
shirt	with	a	Trident	on	it,	run	fifty	miles	to	a	speaking	engagement,	and	show	up
soaking	wet."
Book 2,"Or	I	would	do	push-ups	for	the	first	five	minutes	of	my	speech,	or
roll	a	pull-up	bar	out	on	stage	and	do	pull-ups	while	I	was	talking."
Book 2,"That’s	right,
the	shit	you	see	me	do	on	social	media	isn’t	new."
Book 2,"I’ve	been	living	this	life	for
eleven	years!Wherever	I	stopped,	I	invited	the	kids	who	were	interested	to	come	train	with	me
before	or	after	school,	or	crew	on	one	of	my	ultra	races."
Book 2,"Word	got	out	and	soon
the	media—local	television,	print,	and	radio—showed	up,	especially	if	I	was
running	between	cities	to	get	to	the	next	gig."
Book 2,"I	had	to	be	articulate,	well
groomed,	and	do	well	in	the	races	I	entered."
Book 2,"I	remember	landing	in	Colorado	the	week	of	the	legendary	Leadville	100	trail
race."
Book 2,"The	school	year	had	just	started,	and	on	my	first	night	in	Denver	I	mapped
out	the	five	schools	on	my	roster	in	relation	to	the	trails	I	wanted	to	hike	and	run."
Book 2,"At	each	stop	I’d	invite	the	kids	to	train	with	me,	but	warn	them	that	my	day
started	early."
Book 2,"At	3	a.m.	I	would	drive	to	a	trailhead,	meet	up	with	all	the	students
who	dared	to	show,	and	by	4	a.m.	we’d	begin	power	hiking	up	one	of	Colorado’s
fifty-eight	summits	above	14,000-feet."
Book 2,"Then	we’d	sprint	down	the	mountain	to
strengthen	our	quads."
Book 2,"At	9	a.m.	I	hit	another	school,	and	then	another."
Book 2,"After	the
bell	rang,	I	worked	out	with	the	football,	track,	or	swim	teams	at	the	schools	I
visited,	then	ran	back	into	the	mountains	to	train	until	sunset."
Book 2,"All	of	that	to
recruit	stud	athletes	and	acclimatize	for	the	highest	altitude	ultra	marathon	in	the
world."
Book 2,"The	race	started	at	4	a.m.	on	a	Saturday,	departing	from	the	city	of	Leadville,	a
working-class	ski	town	with	frontier	roots,	and	traversing	a	network	of	beautiful
and	harsh	Rocky	Mountain	trails	that	range	from	9,200	feet	to	12,600	feet	in
elevation."
Book 2,"When	I	finished	at	2	a.m.	on	Sunday,	a	teenager	from	Denver	who
attended	a	school	I’d	visited	a	few	days	earlier	was	waiting	for	me	at	the	finish
line."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	have	a	great	race	(I	came	in	14th	place,	rather	than	my	typical	top
five),	but	I	always	made	sure	to	finish	strong,	and	when	I	sprinted	home	he
approached	me	with	a	wide	smile	and	said,	“I	drove	two	hours	just	to	see	you
finish!”
The	lesson:	you	never	know	who	you’re	affecting."
Book 2,"My	poor	race	results	meant
less	than	nothing	to	that	young	man	because	I’d	helped	open	his	eyes	to	a	new
world	of	possibility	and	capability	that	he	sensed	within	himself."
Book 2,"He’d	followed
me	from	his	high	school	auditorium	to	Leadville	because	he	was	looking	for
absolute	proof—my	finishing	the	race—that	it	was	possible	to	transcend	the
typical	and	become	more,	and	as	I	cooled	down	and	toweled	off	he	asked	me	for
tips	so	he	could	one	day	run	all	day	and	night	through	the	mountains	in	his
backyard.I	have	several	stories	like	that."
Book 2,"More	than	a	dozen	kids	came	out	to	pace	and
crew	for	me	at	the	McNaughton	Park	Trail	Race,	a	150-miler	held	outside	of
Peoria,	Illinois."
Book 2,"Two	dozen	students	trained	with	me	in	Minot,	North	Dakota."
Book 2,"Together	we	ran	the	frozen	tundra	before	sunrise	in	January	when	it	was	twenty
below	zero!	Once	I	spoke	at	a	school	in	a	majority	black	neighborhood	in
Atlanta,	and	as	I	was	leaving,	a	mother	showed	up	with	her	two	sons	who	had
long	dreamed	of	becoming	Navy	SEALs	but	kept	it	a	secret	because	enlisting	in
the	military	wasn’t	considered	cool	in	their	neighborhood."
Book 2,"When	summer
vacation	broke	out,	I	flew	them	to	San	Diego	to	live	and	train	with	me."
Book 2,"I	woke
their	asses	up	at	4	a.m.	and	beat	them	down	on	the	beach	like	they	were	in	a
junior	version	of	First	Phase."
Book 2,"They	did	not	enjoy	themselves,	but	they	learned
the	truth	about	what	it	takes	to	live	the	ethos."
Book 2,"Wherever	I	went,	whether	the
students	were	interested	in	a	military	career	or	not,	they	always	asked	if	they	had
the	same	hardware	I	had."
Book 2,Could	they	run	a	hundred	miles	in	one	day?
Book 2,"What
would	it	take	to	reach	their	full	potential?"
Book 2,"This	is	what	I’d	tell	them:
Our	culture	has	become	hooked	on	the	quick-fix,	the	life	hack,	efficiency."
Book 2,"Everyone	is	on	the	hunt	for	that	simple	action	algorithm	that	nets	maximum
profit	with	the	least	amount	of	effort."
Book 2,"There’s	no	denying	this	attitude	may	get
you	some	of	the	trappings	of	success,	if	you’re	lucky,	but	it	will	not	lead	to	a
calloused	mind	or	self-mastery."
Book 2,"If	you	want	to	master	the	mind	and	remove	your
governor,	you’ll	have	to	become	addicted	to	hard	work."
Book 2,"Because	passion	and
obsession,	even	talent,	are	only	useful	tools	if	you	have	the	work	ethic	to	back
them	up."
Book 2,My	work	ethic	is	the	single	most	important	factor	in	all	of	my	accomplishments.
Book 2,"Everything	else	is	secondary,	and	when	it	comes	to	hard	work,	whether	in	the
gym	or	on	the	job,	The	40%	Rule	applies."
Book 2,"To	me,	a	forty-hour	work	week	is	a	40
percent	effort."
Book 2,"It	may	be	satisfactory,	but	that’s	another	word	for	mediocrity."
Book 2,Don’t	settle	for	a	forty-hour	work	week.
Book 2,"There	are	168	hours	in	a	week!	That
means	you	have	the	hours	to	put	in	that	extra	time	at	work	without	skimping	on
your	exercise."
Book 2,"It	means	streamlining	your	nutrition,	spending	quality	time	with
your	wife	and	kids."
Book 2,"It	means	scheduling	your	life	like	you’re	on	a	twenty-four-
hour	mission	every	single	day."
Book 2,"The	number	one	excuse	I	hear	from	people	as	to	why	they	don’t	work	out	as
much	as	they	want	to	is	that	they	don’t	have	time."
Book 2,"Look,	we	all	have	work
obligations,	none	of	us	want	to	lose	sleep,	and	you’ll	need	time	with	the	familyor	they’ll	trip	the	fuck	out."
Book 2,"I	get	it,	and	if	that’s	your	situation,	you	must	win	the
morning."
Book 2,When	I	was	full-time	with	the	SEALs	I	maximized	the	dark	hours	before	dawn.
Book 2,"When	my	wife	was	sleeping,	I	would	bang	out	a	six-	to	ten-mile	run."
Book 2,"My	gear
was	all	laid	out	the	night	before,	my	lunch	was	packed,	and	my	work	clothes
were	in	my	locker	at	work	where	I’d	shower	before	my	day	started	at	7:30	a.m.
On	a	typical	day,	I’d	be	out	the	door	for	my	run	just	after	4	a.m.	and	back	by
5:15	a.m.	Since	that	wasn’t	enough	for	me,	and	because	we	only	owned	one	car,
I	rode	my	bike	(I	finally	got	my	own	shit!)	twenty-five	miles	to	work."
Book 2,"I’d	work
from	7:30	a.m.	to	noon,	and	eat	at	my	desk	before	or	after	my	lunch	break."
Book 2,"During	the	lunch	hour	I’d	hit	the	gym	or	do	a	four-	to	six-mile	beach	run,	work
the	afternoon	shift	and	hop	on	my	bike	for	the	twenty-five-mile	ride	home."
Book 2,"By
the	time	I	was	home	at	7	p.m.,	I’d	have	run	about	fifteen	miles,	rocked	fifty
miles	on	the	bike,	and	put	in	a	full	day	at	the	office."
Book 2,"I	was	always	home	for
dinner	and	in	bed	by	10	p.m.	so	I	could	do	it	all	over	again	the	next	day."
Book 2,"On
Saturdays	I’d	sleep	in	until	7	a.m.,	hit	a	three-hour	workout,	and	spend	the	rest
of	the	weekend	with	Kate."
Book 2,"If	I	didn’t	have	a	race,	Sundays	were	my	active
recovery	days."
Book 2,"I’d	do	an	easy	ride	at	a	low	heart	rate,	keeping	my	pulse	below
110	beats	per	minute	to	stimulate	healthy	blood	flow."
Book 2,Maybe	you	think	I’m	a	special	case	or	an	obsessive	maniac.
Book 2,"Fine,	I	won’t	argue
with	you."
Book 2,But	what	about	my	friend	Mike?
Book 2,"He’s	a	big-time	financial	advisor	in
New	York	City."
Book 2,"His	job	is	high	pressure	and	his	work	day	is	a	hell	of	a	lot	longer
than	eight	hours."
Book 2,"He	has	a	wife	and	two	kids,	and	he’s	an	ultra	runner."
Book 2,"Here’s
how	he	does	it."
Book 2,"He	wakes	up	at	4	a.m.	every	weekday,	runs	sixty	to	ninety
minutes	each	morning	while	his	family	is	still	snoozing,	rides	a	bike	to	work	and
back	and	does	a	quick	thirty-minute	treadmill	run	after	he	gets	home."
Book 2,"He	goes
out	for	longer	runs	on	weekends,	but	he	minimizes	its	impact	on	his	family
obligations."
Book 2,"He’s	high-powered,	wealthy	as	fuck,	and	could	easily	maintain	his	status	quo
with	less	effort	and	enjoy	the	sweet	fruits	of	his	labors,	but	he	finds	a	way	to	stay
hard	because	his	labors	are	his	sweetest	fruits."
Book 2,"And	he	makes	time	to	get	it	all	in
by	minimizing	the	amount	of	bullshit	clogging	his	schedule."
Book 2,"His	priorities	are
clear,	and	he	remains	dedicated	to	his	priorities."
Book 2,"I’m	not	talking	about	general
priorities	here	either."
Book 2,"Each	hour	of	his	week	is	dedicated	to	a	particular	task	and
when	that	hour	shows	up	in	real	time,	he	focuses	100	percent	on	that	task."
Book 2,"That’show	I	do	it	too,	because	that	is	the	only	way	to	minimize	wasted	hours."
Book 2,"Evaluate	your	life	in	its	totality!	We	all	waste	so	much	time	doing	meaningless
bullshit."
Book 2,"We	burn	hours	on	social	media	and	watching	television,	which	by	the
end	of	the	year	would	add	up	to	entire	days	and	weeks	if	you	tabulated	time	like
you	do	your	taxes."
Book 2,"You	should,	because	if	you	knew	the	truth	you’d	deactivate
your	Facebook	account	STAT,	and	cut	your	cable."
Book 2,"When	you	find	yourself
having	frivolous	conversations	or	becoming	ensnared	in	activities	that	don’t
better	you	in	any	way,	move	the	fuck	on!
For	years	I’ve	lived	like	a	monk."
Book 2,I	don’t	see	or	spend	time	with	a	lot	of	people.
Book 2,My	circle	is	very	tight.
Book 2,"I	post	on	social	media	once	or	twice	a	week	and	I	never
check	anybody	else’s	feeds	because	I	don’t	follow	anyone."
Book 2,That’s	just	me.
Book 2,"I’m
not	saying	you	need	to	be	that	unforgiving,	because	you	and	I	probably	don’t
share	the	same	goals."
Book 2,"But	I	know	you	have	goals	too,	and	room	for
improvement,	or	you	wouldn’t	be	reading	my	book,	and	I	guarantee	that	if	you
audited	your	schedule	you’d	find	time	for	more	work	and	less	bullshit."
Book 2,It’s	up	to	you	to	find	ways	to	eviscerate	your	bullshit.
Book 2,"How	much	time	do	you
spend	at	the	dinner	table	talking	about	nothing	after	the	meal	is	done?"
Book 2,"How
many	calls	and	texts	do	you	send	for	no	reason	at	all?"
Book 2,"Look	at	your	whole	life,
list	your	obligations	and	tasks."
Book 2,Put	a	time	stamp	on	them.
Book 2,"How	many	hours	are
required	to	shop,	eat,	and	clean?"
Book 2,How	much	sleep	do	you	need?
Book 2,"What’s	your
commute	like?"
Book 2,Can	you	make	it	there	under	your	own	power?
Book 2,"Block	everything
into	windows	of	time,	and	once	your	day	is	scheduled	out,	you’ll	know	how
much	flexibility	you	have	to	exercise	on	a	given	day	and	how	to	maximize	it."
Book 2,"Perhaps	you	aren’t	looking	to	get	fit,	but	have	been	dreaming	of	starting	a
business	of	your	own,	or	have	always	wanted	to	learn	a	language	or	an
instrument	you’re	obsessed	with."
Book 2,"Fine,	the	same	rule	applies."
Book 2,"Analyze	your
schedule,	kill	your	empty	habits,	burn	out	the	bullshit,	and	see	what’s	left."
Book 2,"Is	it
one	hour	per	day?"
Book 2,Three?
Book 2,Now	maximize	that	shit.
Book 2,"That	means	listing	your
prioritized	tasks	every	hour	of	the	day."
Book 2,"You	can	even	narrow	it	down	to	fifteen-
minute	windows,	and	don’t	forget	to	include	backstops	in	your	day-to-day
schedule."
Book 2,"Remember	how	I	forgot	to	include	backstops	in	my	race	plan	at
Ultraman?"
Book 2,You	need	backstops	in	your	day-to-day	schedule	too.
Book 2,"If	one	task
bleeds	into	overtime,	make	sure	you	know	it,	and	begin	to	transition	into	your
next	prioritized	task	straight	away."
Book 2,"Use	your	smartphone	for	productivity	hacks,not	click	bait."
Book 2,Turn	on	your	calendar	alerts.
Book 2,Have	those	alarms	set.
Book 2,"If	you	audit	your	life,	skip	the	bullshit,	and	use	backstops,	you’ll	find	time	to	do
everything	you	need	and	want	to	do."
Book 2,"But	remember	that	you	also	need	rest,	so
schedule	that	in."
Book 2,"Listen	to	your	body,	sneak	in	those	ten-	to	twenty-minute	power
naps	when	necessary,	and	take	one	full	rest	day	per	week."
Book 2,"If	it’s	a	rest	day,	truly
allow	your	mind	and	body	to	relax."
Book 2,Turn	your	phone	off.
Book 2,"Keep	the	computer	shut
down."
Book 2,"A	rest	day	means	you	should	be	relaxed,	hanging	with	friends	or	family,
and	eating	and	drinking	well,	so	you	can	recharge	and	get	back	at	it."
Book 2,"It’s	not	a
day	to	lose	yourself	in	technology	or	stay	hunched	at	your	desk	in	the	form	of	a
damn	question	mark."
Book 2,"The	whole	point	of	the	twenty-four-hour	mission	is	to	keep	up	a	championship
pace,	not	for	a	season	or	a	year,	but	for	your	entire	life!	That	requires	quality	rest
and	recovery	time."
Book 2,Because	there	is	no	finish	line.
Book 2,"There	is	always	more	to	learn,
and	you	will	always	have	weaknesses	to	strengthen	if	you	want	to	become	as
hard	as	woodpecker	lips."
Book 2,"Hard	enough	to	hammer	countless	miles,	and	finish
that	shit	strong!
***
In	2008,	I	was	back	in	Kona	for	the	Ironman	World	Championships."
Book 2,"I	was	in
peak	visibility	mode	for	the	Navy	SEALs,	and	Commander	Keith	Davids,	one	of
the	best	athletes	I	ever	saw	in	the	SEAL	teams,	and	I	were	slated	to	do	the	race."
Book 2,"The	NBC	Sports	broadcast	tracked	our	every	move	and	turned	our	race	within
the	race	into	a	feature	the	announcers	could	cut	to	between	clocking	the	main
contenders."
Book 2,Our	entrance	was	straight	out	of	a	Hollywood	pitch	meeting.
Book 2,"While	most	athletes
were	deep	into	their	pre-race	rituals	and	getting	psyched	up	for	the	longest	day
of	their	racing	lives,	we	buzzed	overhead	in	a	C-130,	jumped	from	1,500	feet,
and	parachuted	into	the	water,	where	we	were	scooped	up	by	a	Zodiac	and
motored	to	shore	just	four	minutes	before	the	gun."
Book 2,"That	was	barely	enough	time
for	a	blast	of	energy	gel,	a	swig	of	water,	and	to	change	into	our	Navy	SEAL
triathlon	suits."
Book 2,"You	know	by	now	that	I’m	slow	in	the	water,	and	Davids	destroyed	my	ass	on
the	2.4-mile	swim."
Book 2,"I’m	just	as	strong	as	he	is	on	a	bicycle,	but	my	lower	backtightened	up	that	day	and	at	the	halfway	point	I	had	to	stop	and	stretch	out."
Book 2,"By
the	time	I	coasted	into	the	transition	area	after	a	112-mile	bike	ride,	Davids	had
thirty	minutes	on	me,	and	early	on	in	the	marathon,	I	didn’t	do	a	great	job	of
getting	any	of	it	back."
Book 2,"My	body	was	rebelling	and	I	had	to	walk	those	early
miles,	but	I	stayed	in	the	fight,	and	at	mile	ten	found	a	rhythm	and	started
clipping	time."
Book 2,"Somewhere	ahead	of	me	Davids	blew	up,	and	I	inched	closer."
Book 2,"For
a	few	miles	I	could	see	him	plodding	in	the	distance,	suffering	in	those	lava
fields,	heat	shimmering	off	the	asphalt	in	sheets."
Book 2,"I	knew	he	wanted	to	beat	me
because	he	was	a	proud	man."
Book 2,"He	was	an	Officer,	a	great	operator,	and	a	stud
athlete."
Book 2,I	wanted	to	beat	him	too.
Book 2,"That’s	how	Navy	SEALs	are	wired,	and	I	could
have	blown	by	him,	but	as	I	got	closer	I	told	myself	to	humble	up."
Book 2,"I	caught	him
with	just	over	two	miles	to	go."
Book 2,"He	looked	at	me	with	a	mix	of	respect	and
hilarious	exasperation."
Book 2,"“Fucking	Goggins,”	he	said	with	a	smile."
Book 2,"We’d	jumped	into	the	water	together,
started	the	race	together,	and	we	were	gonna	finish	this	thing	together."
Book 2,"We	ran
side	by	side	for	the	final	two	miles,	crossed	the	finish	line,	and	hugged	it	out."
Book 2,"It
was	terrific	fucking	television.At	the	Kona	Ironman	finish	line	with	Keith	Davids
***
Everything	was	going	well	in	my	life."
Book 2,"My	career	was	spit-shined	and	gleaming,
I’d	made	a	name	for	myself	in	the	sports	world,	and	I	had	plans	to	get	back	onto
the	battlefield	like	a	Navy	SEAL	should."
Book 2,"But	sometimes,	even	when	you	are
doing	everything	right	in	life,	shit	storms	appear	and	multiply."
Book 2,"Chaos	can	and
will	descend	without	warning,	and	when	(not	if)	that	happens,	there	won’t	be
anything	you	can	do	to	stop	it."
Book 2,"If	you’re	fortunate,	the	issues	or	injuries	are	relatively	minor,	and	when	those
incidents	crop	up	it’s	on	you	to	adjust	and	stay	after	it."
Book 2,"If	you	get	injured	or	other
complications	arise	that	prevent	you	from	working	on	your	primary	passion,
refocus	your	energy	elsewhere."
Book 2,"The	activities	we	pursue	tend	to	be	our	strengths
because	its	fun	to	do	what	we’re	great	at."
Book 2,"Very	few	people	enjoy	working	on
their	weaknesses,	so	if	you’re	a	terrific	runner	with	a	knee	injury	that	will
prevent	you	from	running	for	twelve	weeks,	that	is	a	great	time	to	get	into	yoga,
increasing	your	flexibility	and	your	overall	strength,	which	will	make	you	a
better	and	less	injury-prone	athlete."
Book 2,"If	you’re	a	guitar	player	with	a	broken	hand,
sit	down	at	the	keys	and	use	your	one	good	hand	to	become	a	more	versatile
musician."
Book 2,"The	point	is	not	to	allow	a	setback	to	shatter	our	focus,	or	our	detours
to	dictate	our	mindset."
Book 2,"Always	be	ready	to	adjust,	recalibrate,	and	stay	after	it	to
become	better,	somehow."
Book 2,The	sole	reason	I	work	out	like	I	do	isn’t	to	prepare	for	and	win	ultra	races.
Book 2,"I
don’t	have	an	athletic	motive	at	all."
Book 2,It’s	to	prepare	my	mind	for	life	itself.
Book 2,"Life
will	always	be	the	most	grueling	endurance	sport,	and	when	you	train	hard,	get
uncomfortable,	and	callous	your	mind,	you	will	become	a	more	versatile
competitor,	trained	to	find	a	way	forward	no	matter	what."
Book 2,"Because	there	will	be
times	when	the	shit	life	throws	at	you	isn’t	minor	at	all."
Book 2,"Sometimes	life	hits	you
dead	in	the	fucking	heart."
Book 2,"My	two-year	stint	on	recruitment	detail	was	due	to	end	in	2009,	and	while	I
enjoyed	my	time	inspiring	the	next	gen,	I	was	looking	forward	to	getting	back
out	and	operating	in	the	field."
Book 2,"But	before	I	left	my	post	I	planned	one	more	big
splash."
Book 2,"I	would	ride	a	bicycle	from	the	beach	in	San	Diego	to	Annapolis,Maryland,	in	a	legendary	endurance	road	race,	the	Race	Across	America."
Book 2,"The
race	was	in	June,	so	from	January	to	May	I	spent	all	my	free	time	on	the	bike."
Book 2,"I
woke	up	at	4	a.m.	and	rode	110	miles	before	work,	then	rode	twenty	to	thirty
miles	home	at	the	end	of	a	long	work	day."
Book 2,"On	weekends	I	put	in	at	least	one	200-
mile	day,	and	averaged	over	700	miles	per	week."
Book 2,"The	race	would	take	about	two
weeks	to	complete,	there	would	be	very	little	sleep	involved,	and	I	wanted	to	be
ready	for	the	greatest	athletic	challenge	of	my	entire	life.My	RAAM	training	log
Then	in	early	May	everything	capsized."
Book 2,"Like	a	malfunctioning	appliance,	my
heart	went	on	the	blink,	almost	overnight."
Book 2,"For	years	my	resting	pulse	rate	was	in
the	thirties."
Book 2,"Suddenly	it	was	in	the	seventies	and	eighties	and	any	activity	would
spike	it	until	I	verged	on	collapse."
Book 2,"It	was	as	if	I’d	sprung	a	leak,	and	all	my
energy	had	been	sucked	from	my	body."
Book 2,"A	simple	five-minute	bike	ride	would
send	my	heart	racing	to	150	beats	per	minute."
Book 2,"It	pounded	uncontrollably	during	a
short	walk	up	a	single	flight	of	stairs."
Book 2,"At	first	I	thought	it	was	from	overtraining	and	when	I	went	to	the	doctor,	he
agreed,	but	scheduled	an	echocardiogram	for	me	at	Balboa	Hospital	just	in	case."
Book 2,"When	I	went	in	for	the	test,	the	tech	gelled	up	his	all-knowing	receiver	and
rolled	it	over	my	chest	to	get	the	angles	he’d	need	while	I	lay	on	my	left	side,	my
head	away	from	his	monitor."
Book 2,"He	was	a	talker	and	kept	bullshitting	about	a	whole
lot	of	nothing	while	he	checked	out	all	my	chambers	and	valves."
Book 2,"Everything
looked	solid,	he	said,	until	suddenly,	forty-five	minutes	into	the	procedure,	this
chatty	motherfucker	stopped	talking."
Book 2,"Instead	of	his	voice,	I	heard	a	lot	of
clicking	and	zooming."
Book 2,"Then	he	left	the	room	and	reappeared	with	another	tech	a
few	minutes	later."
Book 2,"They	clicked,	zoomed,	and	whispered,	but	didn’t	let	me	in	on
their	big	secret."
Book 2,"When	people	in	white	coats	are	treating	your	heart	as	a	puzzle	to	be	solved	right
in	front	of	you,	it’s	hard	not	to	think	that	you’re	probably	pretty	fucked	up."
Book 2,"Part
of	me	wanted	answers	immediately,	because	I	was	scared	as	shit,	but	I	didn’t
want	to	be	a	bitch	and	show	my	cards,	so	I	opted	to	stay	calm	and	let	the
professionals	work."
Book 2,Within	a	few	minutes	two	other	men	walked	into	the	room.
Book 2,One	of	them	was	a	cardiologist.
Book 2,"He	took	over	the	wand,	rolled	it	on	my	chest,
and	peered	into	the	monitor	with	one	short	nod."
Book 2,"Then	he	patted	me	on	the
shoulder	like	I	was	his	fucking	intern,	and	said,	“Okay,	let’s	talk.”
“You	have	an	Atrial	Septal	Defect,”	he	said	as	we	stood	in	the	hallway,	his	techs
and	nurses	pacing	back	and	forth,	disappearing	into	and	reappearing	from	rooms
on	either	side	of	us."
Book 2,"I	stared	straight	ahead	and	said	nothing	until	he	realized	I
had	no	idea	what	the	fuck	he	was	talking	about."
Book 2,"“You	have	a	hole	in	your	heart.”
He	scrunched	his	forehead	and	stroked	his	chin."
Book 2,"“A	pretty	good-sized	one	too.”“Holes	don’t	just	open	in	your	heart,	do	they?”
“No,	no,”	he	said	with	a	laugh,	“you	were	born	with	it.”
He	went	on	to	explain	that	the	hole	was	in	the	wall	between	my	right	and	left
atria,	which	was	a	problem	because	when	you	have	a	hole	between	the	chambers
in	your	heart,	oxygenated	blood	mixes	with	the	non-oxygenated	blood."
Book 2,"Oxygen
is	an	essential	element	that	every	single	one	of	our	cells	needs	to	survive."
Book 2,"According	to	the	doctor,	I	was	only	supplying	about	half	of	the	necessary
oxygen	my	muscles	and	organs	needed	for	optimal	performance."
Book 2,"That	leads	to	swelling	in	the	feet	and	abdomen,	heart	palpitations,	and	occasional
bouts	of	shortness	of	breath."
Book 2,"It	certainly	explained	the	fatigue	I’d	been	feeling
recently."
Book 2,"It	also	impacts	the	lungs,	he	said,	because	it	floods	the	pulmonary
blood	vessels	with	more	blood	than	they	can	handle,	which	makes	it	much	more
difficult	to	recover	from	overexertion	and	illness."
Book 2,"I	flashed	back	to	all	the	issues
I	had	recovering	after	contracting	double	pneumonia	during	my	first	Hell	Week."
Book 2,The	fluid	I	had	in	my	lungs	never	fully	receded.
Book 2,"During	subsequent	Hell	Weeks,
and	after	getting	into	ultras,	I	found	myself	hocking	up	phlegm	during	and	after
finishing	races."
Book 2,"Some	nights,	there	was	so	much	fluid	in	me	I	couldn’t	sleep."
Book 2,"I’d
just	sit	up	and	spit	phlegm	into	empty	Gatorade	bottles,	wondering	when	that
boring	ritual	would	play	itself	out."
Book 2,"Most	people,	when	they	become	ultra
obsessed,	may	deal	with	overuse	injuries,	but	their	cardiovascular	system	is
finely	tuned."
Book 2,"Even	though	I	was	able	to	compete	and	accomplish	so	much	with
my	broken	body,	I	never	felt	that	great."
Book 2,"I’d	learned	to	endure	and	overcome,	and
as	the	doctor	continued	to	download	the	essentials	I	realized	that	for	the	first
time	in	my	entire	life,	I’d	also	been	pretty	fucking	lucky."
Book 2,"You	know,	the
backhanded	brand	of	luck	where	you	have	a	hole	in	your	heart,	but	are	thanking
God	that	it	hasn’t	killed	you…yet."
Book 2,"Because	when	you	have	an	ASD	like	mine	and	you	dive	deep	under	water,	gas
bubbles,	which	are	supposed	to	travel	through	the	pulmonary	blood	vessels	to	be
filtered	through	the	lungs,	might	leak	from	that	hole	upon	ascent,	and	recirculate
as	weaponized	embolisms	that	can	clog	blood	vessels	in	the	brain	and	lead	to	a
stroke,	or	block	an	artery	to	the	heart,	and	cause	cardiac	arrest."
Book 2,"It’s	like	diving
with	a	dirty	bomb	floating	inside	you,	never	knowing	when	or	where	it	might	go
off.I	wasn’t	alone	in	this	fight."
Book 2,"One	out	of	every	ten	children	are	born	with	this	same
defect,	but	in	most	cases	the	hole	closes	on	its	own,	and	surgery	isn’t	required."
Book 2,"In
just	under	2,000	American	children	each	year,	surgery	is	required,	but	is	usually
administered	before	a	patient	starts	school,	because	there	are	better	screening
processes	these	days."
Book 2,"Most	people	my	age	who	were	born	with	ASD	left	the
hospital	in	their	mothers’	arms	and	lived	with	a	potential	deadly	problem	without
a	clue."
Book 2,"Until,	like	me,	their	heart	started	giving	them	trouble	in	their	thirties."
Book 2,"If	I
had	ignored	my	warning	signs,	I	could	have	dropped	dead	during	a	four-mile
run."
Book 2,"That’s	why	if	you’re	in	the	military	and	are	diagnosed	with	an	ASD,	you	can’t
jump	out	of	airplanes	or	scuba	dive,	and	if	anyone	had	known	of	my	condition
there	is	no	way	the	Navy	ever	would	have	let	me	become	a	SEAL."
Book 2,"It’s
astonishing	I	even	made	it	through	Hell	Week,	Badwater,	or	any	of	those	other
races."
Book 2,"“I’m	truly	amazed	you	could	do	all	you’ve	done	with	this	condition,”	the	doctor
said."
Book 2,I	nodded.
Book 2,"He	thought	I	was	a	medical	marvel,	some	kind	of	outlier,	or	simply	a
gifted	athlete	blessed	with	amazing	luck."
Book 2,"To	me,	it	was	just	further	evidence	that
I	didn’t	owe	my	accomplishments	to	God-given	talent	or	great	genetics."
Book 2,"I	had	a
fucking	hole	in	my	heart!	I	was	running	on	a	tank	perpetually	half	full,	and	that
meant	my	life	was	absolute	proof	of	what’s	possible	when	someone	dedicates
themselves	to	harnessing	the	full	power	of	the	human	mind."
Book 2,Three	days	later	I	was	in	surgery.
Book 2,And	boy	did	the	doctor	fuck	that	one	up.
Book 2,"First	off,	the	anesthesia	didn’t	take	all
the	way,	which	meant	I	was	half	awake	as	the	surgeon	sliced	into	my	inner
thigh,	inserted	a	catheter	into	my	femoral	artery,	and	once	it	reached	my	heart,
deployed	a	helix	patch	through	that	catheter	and	moved	it	into	place,	supposedly
patching	the	hole	in	my	heart."
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	they	had	a	camera	down	my	throat,
which	I	could	feel	as	I	gagged	and	struggled	to	endure	the	two-hour-long
procedure."
Book 2,"After	all	of	that,	my	troubles	were	supposed	to	have	been	over."
Book 2,"The
doctor	mentioned	that	it	would	take	time	for	my	heart	tissue	to	grow	around	and
seal	the	patch,	but	after	a	week	he	cleared	me	for	light	exercise.Roger	that,	I	thought,	as	I	dropped	to	the	floor	to	do	a	set	of	push-ups	as	soon	as
I	got	home."
Book 2,"Almost	immediately	my	heart	went	into	atrial	fibrillation,	also
known	as	a-fib."
Book 2,"My	pulse	spiked	from	120	to	230,	back	to	120	then	up	to	250."
Book 2,"I
felt	dizzy	and	had	to	sit	down	as	I	stared	at	my	heart	rate	monitor,	while	my
breathing	normalized."
Book 2,Once	again	my	resting	heart	rate	was	in	the	eighties.
Book 2,"In
other	words,	nothing	had	changed."
Book 2,"I	called	the	cardiologist	who	tagged	it	a
minor	side	effect	and	begged	patience."
Book 2,"I	took	him	at	his	word	and	rested	for	a
few	more	days	then	hopped	on	the	bike	for	an	easy	ride	home	from	work."
Book 2,"At
first	all	went	well	but	after	about	fifteen	miles,	my	heart	went	into	a-fib	once
again."
Book 2,"My	pulse	rate	bounced	from	120	to	230	and	back	again	across	the
imaginary	graph	in	my	mind’s	eye	with	no	rhythm	whatsoever."
Book 2,"Kate	drove	me
straight	to	Balboa	Hospital."
Book 2,"After	that	visit,	and	second	and	third	opinions,	it	was
clear	that	the	patch	had	either	failed	or	was	insufficient	to	cover	the	entire	hole,
and	that	I’d	need	a	second	heart	surgery."
Book 2,The	Navy	didn’t	want	any	part	of	that.
Book 2,"They	feared	further	complications	and
suggested	I	scale	back	my	lifestyle,	accept	my	new	normal,	and	a	retirement
package."
Book 2,"Yeah,	right."
Book 2,"Instead,	I	found	a	better	doctor	at	Balboa	who	said	we’d
have	to	wait	several	months	before	we	could	even	contemplate	another	heart
surgery."
Book 2,"In	the	meantime,	I	couldn’t	jump	or	dive,	and	obviously	couldn’t
operate	in	the	field,	so	I	stayed	in	recruitment."
Book 2,"It	was	a	different	life,	no	doubt,
and	I	was	tempted	to	feel	sorry	for	myself."
Book 2,"After	all,	this	thing	that	hit	me	out	of
the	clear	blue	changed	the	entire	landscape	of	my	military	career,	but	I’d	been
training	for	life,	not	ultra	races,	and	I	refused	to	hang	my	head."
Book 2,"I	knew	that	if	I	maintained	a	victim’s	mentality	I	wouldn’t	get	anything	at	all	out
of	a	fucked-up	situation,	and	I	didn’t	want	to	sit	home	defeated	all	day	long."
Book 2,"So	I
used	the	time	to	perfect	my	recruitment	presentation."
Book 2,"I	wrote	up	sterling	AARs
and	became	much	more	detail	oriented	in	my	administrative	work."
Book 2,"Does	that
sound	boring	to	you?"
Book 2,"Fuck	yes,	it	was	boring!	But	it	was	honest,	necessary	work,
and	I	used	it	to	keep	my	mind	sharp	for	when	the	moment	came	that	I’d	be	able
to	drop	back	into	the	fight	for	real."
Book 2,Or	so	I	hoped.
Book 2,"A	full	fourteen	months	after	the	first	surgery,	I	was	once	again	rolling	through	a
hospital	corridor	on	my	back,	staring	at	the	fluorescent	lights	in	the	ceiling,
headed	to	pre-op,	with	no	guarantees."
Book 2,"While	the	techs	and	nurses	shaved	medown	and	prepped	me	up,	I	thought	about	all	I’d	accomplished	in	the	military
and	wondered,	was	it	enough?"
Book 2,"If	the	docs	couldn’t	fix	me	this	time	would	I	be
willing	to	retire,	satisfied?"
Book 2,"That	question	lingered	in	my	head	until	the
anesthesiologist	placed	an	oxygen	mask	over	my	face	and	counted	down	softly
in	my	ear."
Book 2,"Just	before	lights	out,	I	heard	the	answer	erupt	from	the	abyss	of	my
jet-black	soul."
Book 2,"Fuck	no!CHALLENGE	#8
Schedule	it	in!
It’s	time	to	compartmentalize	your	day."
Book 2,"Too	many	of	us	have	become
multitaskers,	and	that’s	created	a	nation	of	half-asses."
Book 2,"This	will	be	a	three-week
challenge."
Book 2,"During	week	one,	go	about	your	normal	schedule,	but	take	notes."
Book 2,When	do	you	work?
Book 2,"Are	you	working	nonstop	or	checking	your	phone	(the
Moment	app	will	tell	you)?"
Book 2,How	long	are	your	meal	breaks?
Book 2,"When	do	you
exercise,	watch	TV,	or	chat	to	friends?"
Book 2,How	long	is	your	commute?
Book 2,"Are	you
driving?"
Book 2,I	want	you	to	get	super	detailed	and	document	it	all	with	timestamps.
Book 2,"This	will	be	your	baseline,	and	you’ll	find	plenty	of	fat	to	trim."
Book 2,"Most	people
waste	four	to	five	hours	on	a	given	day,	and	if	you	can	learn	to	identify	and
utilize	it,	you’ll	be	on	your	way	toward	increased	productivity."
Book 2,"In	week	two,	build	an	optimal	schedule."
Book 2,"Lock	everything	into	place	in	fifteen-	to
thirty-minute	blocks."
Book 2,Some	tasks	will	take	multiple	blocks	or	entire	days.
Book 2,Fine.
Book 2,"When	you	work,	only	work	on	one	thing	at	a	time,	think	about	the	task	in	front
of	you	and	pursue	it	relentlessly."
Book 2,"When	it	comes	time	for	the	next	task	on	your
schedule,	place	that	first	one	aside,	and	apply	the	same	focus."
Book 2,"Make	sure	your	meal	breaks	are	adequate	but	not	open-ended,	and	schedule	in
exercise	and	rest	too."
Book 2,"But	when	it’s	time	to	rest,	actually	rest."
Book 2,"No	checking	email
or	bullshitting	on	social	media."
Book 2,"If	you	are	going	to	work	hard	you	must	also	rest
your	brain."
Book 2,Make	notes	with	timestamps	in	week	two.
Book 2,"You	may	still	find	some	residual	dead
space."
Book 2,"By	week	three,	you	should	have	a	working	schedule	that	maximizes	your
effort	without	sacrificing	sleep."
Book 2,"Post	photos	of	your	schedule,	with	the	hashtags
#canthurtme	#talentnotrequired.CHAPTER	NINE
9."
Book 2,"UNCOMMON	AMONGST	UNCOMMON
The	anesthesia	took	hold,	and	I	felt	myself	wheeling	backward	until	I	landed	in	a
scene	from	my	past."
Book 2,We	were	humping	through	the	jungle	in	the	dead	of	night.
Book 2,"Our	movement	was	stealthy	and	silent,	but	swift."
Book 2,Had	to	be.
Book 2,"He	who	hits	first
wins	the	fight,	most	of	the	time."
Book 2,"We	crested	a	pass,	took	shelter	beneath	a	thick	stand	of	towering	mahogany	trees
in	the	triple	canopy	jungle,	and	tracked	our	targets	through	night	vision	goggles."
Book 2,"Even	without	sunlight,	the	tropical	heat	was	intense	and	sweat	slid	down	the	side
of	my	face	like	dew	drops	on	a	window	pane."
Book 2,"I	was	twenty-seven	years	old,	and
my	Platoon	and	Rambo	fever	dreams	had	become	real	as	fuck."
Book 2,"I	blinked	twice,
exhaled,	and	on	the	OIC’s	signal,	opened	fire."
Book 2,"My	entire	body	reverberated	with	the	rhythm	of	the	M60,	a	belt-fed	machine
gun,	firing	500–650	rounds	per	minute."
Book 2,"As	the	one-hundred-round	belt	fed	the
growling	machine	and	flared	from	the	barrel,	adrenaline	flooded	my	bloodstream
and	saturated	my	brain."
Book 2,My	focus	narrowed.
Book 2,"There	was	nothing	else	but	me,	my
weapon,	and	the	target	I	was	shredding	with	zero	apologies."
Book 2,"It	was	2002,	I	was	fresh	out	of	BUD/S,	and	as	a	full-time	Navy	SEAL,	I	was
now	officially	one	of	the	world’s	most	fit	and	deadly	warriors	and	one	of	the
hardest	men	alive."
Book 2,"Or	so	I	thought,	but	this	was	years	before	my	descent	into	the
ultra	rabbit	hole."
Book 2,"September	11th	was	still	a	fresh,	gaping	wound	in	the
American	collective	consciousness,	and	its	ripple	effects	changed	everything	for
guys	like	us."
Book 2,Combat	was	no	longer	a	mythical	state	of	mind	we	aspired	to.
Book 2,"It
was	real	and	ongoing	in	the	mountains,	villages,	and	cities	of	Afghanistan."
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	we	were	moored	in	fucking	Malaysia,	awaiting	orders,	hoping	to
join	the	fight."
Book 2,And	we	trained	like	it.
Book 2,"After	BUD/S,	I	moved	on	to	SEAL	Qualification	Training,	where	I	officiallyearned	my	Trident	before	landing	in	my	first	platoon."
Book 2,"Training	continued	with
jungle	warfare	exercises	in	Malaysia."
Book 2,"We	rappelled	and	fast-roped	up	and	down
from	hovering	helicopters."
Book 2,"Some	men	were	trained	as	snipers,	and	since	I	was
the	biggest	man	in	the	unit—my	weight	was	back	up	to	250	pounds	by	then—I
scored	the	job	of	carrying	the	Pig,	the	nickname	for	the	M60	because	it	sounded
like	the	grunt	of	a	barnyard	hog.SQT	graduation	(note	the	blood	stains	from	the	Trident	being	punched	into	my	chest)
Most	people	dreaded	Pig	detail,	but	I	was	obsessed	with	that	gun."
Book 2,"The	weapon
alone	was	twenty	pounds,	and	each	belt	of	one-hundred	rounds	weighed	in	at
seven	pounds."
Book 2,"I	carried	six	to	seven	of	those	(one	on	the	gun,	four	on	my	waist,
and	one	in	a	pouch	strapped	to	my	rucksack),	the	weapon,	and	my	fifty-poundruck	everywhere	we	went	and	was	expected	to	move	just	as	fast	as	everyone
else."
Book 2,I	had	no	choice.
Book 2,"We	train	as	we	fight,	and	live	ammo	is	necessary	to	mimic
true	combat	so	we	could	perfect	the	SEAL	battle	maxim:	shoot,	move,
communicate."
Book 2,That	meant	keeping	barrel	discretion	on	point.
Book 2,"We	couldn’t	let	our	weapon	spray
just	anywhere."
Book 2,"That’s	how	friendly	fire	incidents	happen,	and	it	takes	great
muscle	discipline	and	attention	to	detail	to	know	where	you’re	aiming	in	relation
to	the	location	of	your	teammates	at	all	times,	especially	when	armed	with	the
Pig."
Book 2,"Maintaining	a	high	standard	of	safety	and	delivering	deadly	force	on-target
when	duty	calls	is	what	makes	an	average	SEAL	a	good	operator."
Book 2,"Most	people	think	once	you’re	a	SEAL	you’re	always	in	the	circle,	but	that’s	not
true."
Book 2,"I	learned	quickly	that	we	were	constantly	being	judged,	and	the	second	I
was	unsafe,	whether	I	was	still	a	new	guy	or	a	veteran	operator,	I’d	be	out!	I	was
one	of	three	new	guys	in	my	first	platoon,	and	one	of	them	had	to	have	his	gun
taken	away	because	he	was	so	unsafe."
Book 2,"For	ten	days,	we	moved	through	the
Malaysian	jungle,	sleeping	in	hammocks,	paddling	dugouts,	carrying	our
weapons	all	day	and	night,	and	he	was	stuck	hauling	a	fucking	broomstick	like
the	Wicked	Witch	of	the	West."
Book 2,"Even	then	he	couldn’t	hack	it	and	wound	up
getting	booted."
Book 2,"Our	officers	in	that	first	platoon	kept	everybody	honest,	and	I
respected	them	for	it."
Book 2,"“In	combat,	nobody	just	turns	into	Rambo,”	Dana	De	Coster	told	me	recently."
Book 2,Dana	was	second	in	command	on	my	first	platoon	with	SEAL	Team	Five.
Book 2,"These
days	he’s	Director	of	Operations	at	BUD/S."
Book 2,"“We	push	ourselves	hard	so	when
bullets	do	start	flying	we	fall	back	on	really	good	training,	and	it’s	important	that
the	point	where	we	fall	back	is	so	high,	we	know	we’re	gonna	outperform	the
enemy."
Book 2,"We	may	not	become	Rambo,	but	we’ll	be	damn	close.”
A	lot	of	people	are	fascinated	by	the	weaponry	and	gunfights	SEALs	utilize	and
engage	in,	but	that	was	never	my	favorite	part	of	the	job."
Book 2,"I	was	damn	good	at	it,
but	I	preferred	going	to	war	with	myself."
Book 2,"I’m	talking	about	strong	physical
training,	and	my	first	platoon	delivered	that	too."
Book 2,"We	would	go	on	long	run-
swim-runs	most	mornings	before	work."
Book 2,We	weren’t	just	getting	miles	in	either.
Book 2,"We	were	competing,	and	our	officers	led	from	the	front."
Book 2,"Our	OIC	and	Dana,	his
second,	were	two	of	the	best	athletes	in	the	entire	platoon	and	my	Platoon	Chief,
Chris	Beck	(who	now	goes	by	Kristin	Beck,	and	is	one	of	most	famous	transwomen	on	Twitter;	talk	about	being	the	only!),	was	a	hard	motherfucker	too."
Book 2,"“It’s	funny,”	Dana	said,	“[the	OIC	and	I]	never	really	talked	about	our
philosophy	on	PT."
Book 2,We	just	competed.
Book 2,"I	wanted	to	beat	him	and	he	wanted	to
beat	me,	and	that	got	people	talking	about	how	hard	we	were	getting	after	it.”
There	was	never	a	doubt	in	my	mind	that	Dana	was	off	his	damn	rocker."
Book 2,"I
remember	before	we	shipped	out	for	Indonesia,	with	stops	in	Guam,	Malaysia,
Thailand,	and	Korea,	we	did	a	number	of	training	dives	off	San	Clemente	Island."
Book 2,"Dana	was	my	swim	buddy,	and	one	morning	he	challenged	me	to	do	a	training
dive	in	fifty-five-degree	water	without	a	wetsuit	because	that’s	how	the
predecessors	to	the	SEALs	did	it	when	they	prepared	the	beaches	in	Normandy
for	the	famous	D-Day	invasion	during	World	War	II."
Book 2,"“Let’s	go	old	school	and	dive	in	shorts	with	our	dive	knives,”	he	said."
Book 2,"He	had	the	animalistic	mentality	I	thrived	on,	and	I	wasn’t	about	to	back	down
from	that	challenge."
Book 2,"We	swam	and	dove	together	all	over	Southeast	Asia,	where
we	trained	elite	military	units	in	Malaysia	and	sharpened	the	skills	of	Thai	Navy
SEALs—the	crew	of	frogmen	who	saved	the	soccer	kids	in	the	cave	in	the
summer	of	2018."
Book 2,"They	were	engaged	with	an	Islamist	insurgency	in	South
Thailand."
Book 2,"Wherever	we	deployed,	I	loved	those	PT	mornings	above	all	else."
Book 2,"Pretty	soon,	every	man	in	that	platoon	was	competing	against	everyone	else,	but
no	matter	how	hard	I	tried	I	couldn’t	seem	to	catch	our	two	officers	and	usually
came	in	third	place."
Book 2,Didn’t	matter.
Book 2,"It	wasn’t	important	who	won	because
everybody	was	capping	personal	bests	almost	every	day,	and	that’s	what	stayed
with	me."
Book 2,"The	power	of	a	competitive	environment	to	amp	up	an	entire	platoon’s
commitment	and	achievement!
This	was	exactly	the	environment	I’d	been	dreaming	of	when	I	classed	up	for
BUD/S."
Book 2,"We	were	all	living	the	SEAL	ethos,	and	I	couldn’t	wait	to	see	where	it
took	us	individually	and	as	a	unit	once	we	tagged	into	the	fight."
Book 2,"But	as	war	raged
in	Afghanistan,	all	we	could	do	was	sit	tight	and	hope	our	number	was	called."
Book 2,"We	were	in	a	Korean	bowling	alley	when	we	watched	the	invasion	of	Iraq
together."
Book 2,It	was	depressing	as	hell.
Book 2,"We	had	been	training	hard	for	an	opportunity
like	that."
Book 2,"Our	foundation	had	been	reinforced	with	all	that	PT,	and	filled	out	with
robust	weapons	and	tactical	training."
Book 2,"We’d	become	a	deadly	unit	frothing	to	be	apart	of	the	action,	and	the	fact	that	we	were	passed	over	again	pissed	us	all	off."
Book 2,So	we	took	it	out	on	one	another	every	morning.
Book 2,"Navy	SEALs	were	treated	like	rock	stars	at	the	bases	we	visited	around	the
world,	and	some	of	the	guys	partied	like	it."
Book 2,"In	fact,	most	SEALs	enjoyed	their
share	of	big	nights	out,	but	not	me."
Book 2,"I’d	gotten	into	the	SEALs	by	living	a	Spartan
lifestyle	and	felt	my	job	at	night	was	to	rest,	recharge,	and	get	my	body	and	mind
right	for	battle	again	the	next	day."
Book 2,"I	was	forever	mission-ready,	and	my	attitude
earned	respect	from	some,	but	our	OIC	tried	to	influence	me	to	let	go	a	little	and
become	“one	of	the	boys.”
I	had	great	respect	for	our	OIC."
Book 2,"He’d	graduated	from	the	Naval	Academy	and
the	University	of	Cambridge."
Book 2,"He	was	clearly	smart,	a	stud	athlete,	and	a	great
leader,	on	his	way	to	claiming	a	coveted	spot	on	DEVGRU,	so	his	opinion
mattered	to	me."
Book 2,"It	mattered	to	all	of	us,	because	he	was	responsible	for
evaluating	us	and	those	evaluations	have	a	way	of	following	you	around	and
affecting	your	military	career	going	forward."
Book 2,"On	paper,	my	first	evaluation	was	solid."
Book 2,"He	was	impressed	with	my	skills	and
all-out	effort,	but	he	also	dropped	some	off	the	record	wisdom."
Book 2,"“You	know,
Goggins,”	he	said,	“you’d	understand	the	job	a	little	better	if	you	hung	out	with
the	guys	more."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	learn	the	most	about	operating	in	the	field,	hanging
with	the	boys,	hearing	their	stories."
Book 2,"It’s	important	to	be	part	of	the	group.”
His	words	were	a	reality	check	that	hurt."
Book 2,"Clearly,	the	OIC,	and	probably	some	of
the	other	guys,	thought	I	was	a	little	different."
Book 2,"Of	course	I	was!	I	came	from
fucking	nothing!	I	didn’t	get	recruited	to	the	Naval	Academy."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	even	know
where	the	fuck	Cambridge	was."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	raised	around	pools.
Book 2,"I	had	to	teach
myself	to	swim."
Book 2,"Fuck,	I	shouldn’t	have	even	been	a	SEAL,	but	I	made	it,	and	I
thought	that	made	me	part	of	the	group,	but	now	I	realized	I	was	part	of	the
Teams—not	the	brotherhood."
Book 2,I	had	to	go	out	and	socialize	with	the	guys	after	hours	to	prove	my	value?
Book 2,"That
was	a	big	ask	for	an	introvert	like	me."
Book 2,Fuck	that.
Book 2,I’d	arrived	in	that	platoon	because	of	my	intense	dedication	and	I	wasn’t	about	tolet	up.
Book 2,"While	people	were	out	at	night	I	was	reading	up	on	tactics,	weaponry,	and
war."
Book 2,"I	was	a	perpetual	student!	In	my	mind	I	was	training	for	opportunities	that
didn’t	even	exist	yet."
Book 2,"Back	then	you	couldn’t	screen	to	join	DEVGRU	until	after
you	finished	your	second	platoon,	but	I	was	already	preparing	for	that
opportunity,	and	I	refused	to	compromise	who	I	was	to	conform	to	their
unwritten	rules."
Book 2,"DEVGRU	(and	the	Army’s	Delta	Force)	are	considered	the	very	best	within	the
best	of	special	operations."
Book 2,"They	get	the	tip	of	the	spear	missions,	like	the	Osama
Bin	Laden	raid,	and	from	that	point	on,	I	decided	I	wouldn’t	and	couldn’t	be
satisfied	just	being	a	vanilla	Navy	SEAL."
Book 2,"Yeah,	we	were	all	uncommon,	hard
motherfuckers	compared	to	civilians,	but	now	I	saw	I	was	uncommon	even
among	the	uncommon,	and	if	that’s	who	I	was,	then	so	the	fuck	be	it."
Book 2,"I	may	as
well	separate	myself	even	more."
Book 2,"Not	long	after	that	evaluation,	I	won	the
morning	race	for	the	first	time."
Book 2,"I	passed	up	Dana	and	the	OIC	in	the	last	half
mile	and	never	looked	back."
Book 2,"Platoon	assignments	last	for	two	years,	and	by	the	end	of	our	deployment	most
of	the	guys	were	ready	for	a	breather	before	tackling	their	next	platoon,	which
judging	by	the	wars	we	were	involved	in	were	almost	guaranteed	to	take	them
into	combat."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	want	or	need	a	break	because	the	uncommon	among
uncommon	don’t	take	breaks!
After	my	first	evaluation	I	started	studying	the	other	branches	in	the	military
(Coast	Guard	not	included)	and	read	up	on	their	special	forces."
Book 2,"Navy	SEALs	like
to	think	that	we’re	the	best	of	them	all,	but	I	wanted	to	see	for	myself."
Book 2,"I
suspected	all	the	branches	employed	a	few	individuals	who	stood	out	in	the
worst	environments."
Book 2,"I	was	on	a	hunt	to	find	and	train	with	those	guys	because	I
knew	they	could	make	me	better."
Book 2,"Plus,	I’d	read	that	Army	Ranger	School	was
known	as	one	of	the	best,	if	not	the	best,	leadership	schools	in	the	entire	military,
so	during	my	first	platoon,	I	put	seven	chits	in	with	my	OIC	hoping	to	get
approval	to	go	to	Army	Ranger	School	between	deployments."
Book 2,"I	wanted	to
sponge	more	knowledge,	I	told	him,	and	become	more	skilled	as	a	special
operator."
Book 2,"Chits	are	special	requests,	and	my	first	six	were	ignored."
Book 2,"I	was	a	new	guy,	after
all,	and	some	thought	my	focus	should	remain	within	Naval	Special	Warfare,
rather	than	stray	into	the	dreaded	Army."
Book 2,"But	I’d	earned	my	own	reputation	afterserving	two	years	in	my	first	platoon,	and	my	seventh	request	went	up	the	ladder
to	the	CO	in	charge	of	Seal	Team	Five."
Book 2,"When	he	signed	off,	I	was	in."
Book 2,"“Goggins,”	my	OIC	said	after	giving	me	the	good	news,	“you	are	the	type	of
motherfucker	who	wishes	you	were	a	POW	just	to	see	if	you	have	what	it	takes
to	last.”
He	was	onto	me."
Book 2,"He	knew	the	kind	of	person	I	was	becoming—the	type	of	man
willing	to	challenge	myself	to	the	nth	degree."
Book 2,We	shook	hands.
Book 2,"The	OIC	was	off
to	DEVGRU,	and	there	was	a	chance	we’d	meet	there	soon."
Book 2,"He	told	me	that	with
two	ongoing	wars,	for	the	first	time	DEVGRU	had	opened	their	recruitment
process	to	include	guys	off	their	first	platoon."
Book 2,"By	always	searching	for	more	and
preparing	my	mind	and	body	for	opportunities	that	didn’t	yet	exist,	I	was	one	of
a	handful	of	men	on	the	West	Coast	approved	by	SEAL	Team	Five	brass	to
screen	for	Green	Team,	the	training	program	for	DEVGRU,	just	before	I	left	for
Army	Ranger	School."
Book 2,The	Green	Team	screening	process	unfolds	over	two	days.
Book 2,"The	first	day	is	the
physical	fitness	portion,	which	included	a	three-mile	run,	a	1,200-meter	swim,
three	minutes	of	sit-ups	and	push-ups,	and	a	max	set	of	pull-ups."
Book 2,"I	smoked
everybody,	because	my	first	platoon	had	made	me	a	much	stronger	swimmer	and
a	better	runner."
Book 2,"Day	two	was	the	interview,	which	was	more	like	an
interrogation."
Book 2,"Only	three	men	from	my	screening	class	of	eighteen	guys	were
approved	for	Green	Team."
Book 2,"I	was	one	of	them,	which	theoretically	meant	that
after	my	second	platoon	I’d	be	one	step	closer	to	joining	DEVGRU."
Book 2,"I	could
hardly	wait."
Book 2,"It	was	December	2003,	and	as	imagined,	my	special	forces	career
was	zooming	into	hyperspace	because	I	kept	proving	myself	to	be	the	most
uncommon	of	motherfuckers,	and	remained	on	track	to	become	that	One
Warrior."
Book 2,"A	few	weeks	later,	I	arrived	in	Fort	Benning,	Georgia,	for	Army	Ranger	School."
Book 2,"It	was	early	December,	and	as	the	only	Navy	guy	in	a	class	of	308	men,	I	was
greeted	with	skepticism	by	the	instructors	because	a	few	classes	before	mine,	a
couple	of	Navy	SEALs	quit	in	the	middle	of	training."
Book 2,"Back	then	they	used	to
send	Navy	SEALs	to	Ranger	School	as	punishment,	so	they	may	not	have	been
the	best	representatives."
Book 2,"I’d	been	begging	to	go,	but	the	instructors	didn’t	know
that	yet."
Book 2,They	thought	I	was	just	another	cocky	special	ops	guy.
Book 2,"Within	hours
they	stripped	me	and	everyone	else	of	our	uniforms	and	reputations	until	we	alllooked	the	same."
Book 2,"Officers	lost	rank,	and	minted	special	forces	warriors	like	me
became	nobodies	with	a	hell	of	a	lot	to	prove."
Book 2,"On	day	one,	we	were	split	into	three	companies	and	I	was	appointed	first
sergeant	in	command	of	Bravo	company."
Book 2,"I	got	the	job	because	the	original	first
sergeant	had	been	asked	to	recite	the	Ranger	Creed	after	a	beat	down	on	the	pull-
up	bar,	and	he	was	so	tired	he	fucked	it	up."
Book 2,"To	Rangers,	their	creed	is	everything."
Book 2,"Our	Ranger	Instructor	(RI)	was	livid	as	he	took	stock	of	Bravo	company,	all	of
us	locked	at	attention."
Book 2,"“I	don’t	know	where	you	think	you	men	are,	but	if	you	expect	to	become
Rangers	then	I	expect	you	to	know	our	creed.”	His	eyes	found	me."
Book 2,"“I	know	for	a
fact	Old	Navy	here	doesn’t	know	the	Ranger	Creed.”
I’d	been	studying	it	for	months	and	could	have	recited	it	while	standing	on	my
head."
Book 2,"For	effect,	I	cleared	my	throat	and	got	loud."
Book 2,"“Recognizing	that	I	volunteered	as	a	Ranger,	fully	knowing	the	hazards	of	my
chosen	profession,	I	will	always	endeavor	to	uphold	the	prestige,	honor,	and
high	spirit	de	corps	of	the	Rangers!”
“Very	surpri…”	He	tried	to	cut	me	off,	but	I	wasn’t	done."
Book 2,"“Acknowledging	the	fact	that	a	Ranger	is	a	more	elite	Soldier	who	arrives	at	the
cutting	edge	of	battle	by	land,	sea,	or	air,	I	accept	the	fact	that	as	a	Ranger	my
country	expects	me	to	move	further,	faster,	and	fight	harder	than	any	other
Solider!”
The	RI	nodded	with	a	wry	smile,	but	this	time	stayed	out	of	my	way."
Book 2,"“Never	shall	I	fail	my	comrades!	I	will	always	keep	myself	mentally	alert,
physically	strong,	and	morally	straight,	and	I	will	shoulder	more	than	my	share
of	the	task	whatever	it	may	be,	100	percent	and	then	some!
“Gallantly	will	I	show	the	world	that	I	am	a	specially	selected	and	well-trained
Soldier!	My	courtesy	to	superior	officers,	neatness	of	dress,	and	care	of
equipment	shall	set	the	example	for	others	to	follow!
“Energetically	will	I	meet	the	enemies	of	my	country!	I	shall	defeat	them	on	thefield	of	battle	for	I	am	better	trained	and	will	fight	with	all	my	might!	Surrender
is	not	a	Ranger	word!	I	will	never	leave	a	fallen	comrade	to	fall	into	the	hands	of
the	enemy	and	under	no	circumstances	will	I	ever	embarrass	my	country!
“Readily	will	I	display	the	intestinal	fortitude	required	to	fight	on	to	the	Ranger
objective	and	complete	the	mission	though	I	be	the	lone	survivor!
“Rangers	lead	the	way!”
I	recited	all	six	stanzas,	and	afterward	he	shook	his	head	in	disbelief,	and	mulled
the	ideal	way	to	get	the	last	laugh."
Book 2,"“Congratulations,	Goggins,”	he	said,	“you	are
now	first	sergeant.”
He	left	me	there,	in	front	of	my	platoon,	speechless."
Book 2,"It	was	now	my	job	to	march
our	platoon	around	and	make	sure	every	man	was	prepared	for	whatever	lay	in
front	of	us."
Book 2,"I	became	part	boss,	part	big	brother,	and	full-time	quasi-instructor."
Book 2,"In
Ranger	School	it’s	hard	enough	to	get	yourself	squared	away	enough	to
graduate."
Book 2,"Now	I	had	to	look	after	a	hundred	men	and	make	sure	they	had	their
shit	together,	too."
Book 2,"Plus,	I	still	had	to	go	through	the	same	evolutions	as	everyone	else,	but	that	was
the	easy	part	and	actually	gave	me	a	chance	to	chill	out."
Book 2,"For	me	the	physical
punishment	was	more	than	manageable,	but	the	way	I	went	about	accomplishing
those	physical	tasks	had	shifted."
Book 2,"In	BUD/S	I’d	always	lead	my	boat	crews,	often
with	tough	love,	but	in	general	I	didn’t	care	how	the	guys	in	the	other	boat	crews
were	doing	or	if	they	quit."
Book 2,"This	time,	I	wasn’t	just	putting	out,	I	was	also	looking
after	everybody."
Book 2,"If	I	saw	someone	having	trouble	with	navigation,	patrolling,
keeping	up	on	a	run,	or	staying	awake	all	night,	I	made	sure	we	all	rallied
together	to	help."
Book 2,Not	everybody	wanted	to.
Book 2,"The	training	was	so	difficult	that
when	some	guys	weren’t	on	the	clock	being	graded,	they	did	the	bare	minimum
and	found	opportunities	to	rest	and	hide."
Book 2,"In	my	sixty-nine	days	at	Ranger	School
I	didn’t	coast	for	a	single	second."
Book 2,I	was	becoming	a	true	leader.
Book 2,"The	whole	point	of	Ranger	School	is	to	give	every	man	a	taste	of	what	it	takes	to
lead	a	high-level	team."
Book 2,"The	field	exercises	were	like	an	operator’s	scavenger
hunt	blended	with	an	endurance	race."
Book 2,"Over	the	course	of	six	testing	phases	we
were	evaluated	on	navigation,	weapons,	rope	techniques,	reconnaissance,	and
overall	leadership."
Book 2,The	field	tests	were	notorious	for	their	Spartan	brutality	andcapped	three	separate	phases	of	training.
Book 2,"First,	we	were	split	into	groups	of	twelve	men	and	together	spent	five	days	and
four	nights	in	the	foothills	for	Fort	Benning	phase."
Book 2,"We	were	given	very	little
food	to	eat—one	or	two	MREs	per	day—and	only	a	couple	of	hours	sleep	per
night,	as	we	raced	the	clock	to	navigate	cross-country	terrain	between	stations
where	we’d	knock	off	a	series	of	tasks	to	prove	our	proficiency	in	a	particular
skill."
Book 2,Leadership	in	the	group	rotated	between	men.
Book 2,Mountain	phase	was	exponentially	harder	than	Fort	Benning.
Book 2,"Now	we	were
grouped	into	teams	of	twenty-five	men	to	navigate	the	mountains	in	north
Georgia,	and	buddy,	Appalachia	gets	cold	as	fuck	in	wintertime."
Book 2,"I’d	read	stories
about	black	soldiers	with	Sickle	Cell	Trait	dying	during	Mountain	Phase,	and	the
Army	wanted	me	to	wear	special	dog	tags	with	a	red	casing	to	alert	medics	if
something	went	wrong,	but	I	was	leading	men	and	didn’t	want	my	crew	to	think
of	me	as	some	sickly	child,	so	the	red	casing	never	quite	found	its	way	to	my
dog	tags."
Book 2,"In	the	mountains	we	learned	how	to	rappel	and	rock	climb,	among	other
mountaineering	skills,	and	became	proficient	in	ambush	techniques	and
mountain	patrol."
Book 2,"To	prove	it	we	went	out	on	two	separate,	four-night	field
training	exercises,	known	as	FTXs.	A	storm	blew	in	during	our	second	FTX."
Book 2,Thirty-mile-per-hour	winds	howled	with	ice	and	snow.
Book 2,"We	didn’t	haul	sleeping
bags	or	warm	clothes,	and	again	we	had	very	little	food."
Book 2,"All	we	could	use	to
keep	warm	was	a	poncho	liner	and	one	another,	which	was	an	issue	because	the
rancid	odor	in	the	air	was	our	own."
Book 2,"We’d	burned	so	many	calories	without
proper	nutrition,	we’d	lost	all	our	fat	and	were	incinerating	our	own	muscle	mass
for	fuel."
Book 2,The	putrid	stink	made	our	eyes	water.
Book 2,It	triggered	the	gag	reflex.
Book 2,Visibility	narrowed	to	a	few	feet.
Book 2,"Guys	wheezed,	coughed,	and	jackhammered,
their	eyes	wide	with	terror."
Book 2,"I	thought	for	sure	someone	was	gonna	die	from
frostbite,	hypothermia,	or	pneumonia	that	night."
Book 2,"Whenever	you	stop	to	sleep	during	field	tests,	rest	is	brief	and	you’re	required	to
maintain	security	in	four	directions,	but	in	the	face	of	that	storm,	Bravo	platoon
buckled."
Book 2,"These	were	generally	very	hard	men	with	a	ton	of	pride,	but	they	were
focused	on	survival	above	all	else."
Book 2,"I	understood	the	impulse,	and	the	instructors
didn’t	mind	because	we	were	in	weather	emergency	mode,	but	to	me	that
presented	an	opportunity	to	stand	apart	and	lead	by	example."
Book 2,I	looked	at	thatwinter	storm	as	a	platform	to	become	uncommon	among	uncommon	men.
Book 2,"No	matter	who	you	are,	life	will	present	you	similar	opportunities	where	you	can
prove	to	be	uncommon."
Book 2,"There	are	people	in	all	walks	of	life	who	relish	those
moments,	and	when	I	see	them	I	recognize	them	immediately	because	they	are
usually	that	motherfucker	who’s	all	by	himself."
Book 2,"It’s	the	suit	who’s	still	at	the
office	at	midnight	while	everyone	else	is	at	the	bar,	or	the	badass	who	hits	the
gym	directly	after	coming	off	a	forty-eight-hour	op."
Book 2,"She’s	the	wildland
firefighter	who	instead	of	hitting	her	bedroll,	sharpens	her	chainsaw	after
working	a	fire	for	twenty-four	hours."
Book 2,That	mentality	is	there	for	all	of	us.
Book 2,"Man,
woman,	straight,	gay,	black,	white,	or	purple	fucking	polkadot."
Book 2,"All	of	us	can	be
the	person	who	flies	all	day	and	night	only	to	arrive	home	to	a	filthy	house,	and
instead	of	blaming	family	or	roommates,	cleans	it	up	right	then	because	they
refuse	to	ignore	duties	undone."
Book 2,All	over	the	world	amazing	human	beings	like	that	exist.
Book 2,"It	doesn’t	take	wearing
a	uniform."
Book 2,"It’s	not	about	all	the	hard	schools	they	graduated	from,	all	their
patches	and	medals."
Book 2,"It’s	about	wanting	it	like	there’s	no	tomorrow—because
there	might	not	be."
Book 2,"It’s	about	thinking	of	everybody	else	before	yourself	and
developing	your	own	code	of	ethics	that	sets	you	apart	from	others."
Book 2,"One	of	those
ethics	is	the	drive	to	turn	every	negative	into	a	positive,	and	then	when	shit	starts
flying,	being	prepared	to	lead	from	the	front."
Book 2,"My	thinking	on	that	Georgia	mountaintop	was	that,	in	a	real-world	scenario,	a
storm	like	that	would	provide	the	perfect	cover	for	an	enemy	attack,	so	I	didn’t
group	up	and	seek	warmth."
Book 2,"I	dialed	deeper,	welcomed	the	carnage	of	ice	and
snow,	and	held	the	western	perimeter	like	it	was	my	duty—because	it	damn	well
was!	And	I	loved	every	second	of	it."
Book 2,"I	squinted	into	the	wind,	and	as	hail	stung
my	cheeks,	I	screamed	into	the	night	from	the	depths	of	my	misunderstood	soul."
Book 2,"A	few	guys	heard	me,	popped	out	of	the	tree	line	to	the	north,	and	stood	tall."
Book 2,"Then	another	guy	emerged	to	the	east,	and	another	on	the	edge	of	the	south-
facing	slope."
Book 2,"They	were	all	shivering,	wrapped	in	their	measly	poncho	liners."
Book 2,"None	of	them	wanted	to	be	there,	but	they	rose	up	and	did	their	duty."
Book 2,"In	spite	of
one	of	the	most	brutal	storms	in	Ranger	School	history,	we	held	a	complete
perimeter	until	the	instructors	radioed	us	to	come	in	from	the	cold."
Book 2,Literally.
Book 2,They	put	up	a	circus	tent.
Book 2,"We	filed	in	and	huddled	up	until	the	storm	passed.The	final	weeks	in	Ranger	School	are	called	Florida	Phase,	a	ten-day	FTX	in
which	fifty	men	navigate	the	panhandle,	GPS	point	by	GPS	point,	as	a	single
unit."
Book 2,"It	started	with	a	static	line	jump	from	an	aircraft	at	1,500	feet	into	frigid
swamplands	near	Fort	Walton	Beach."
Book 2,"We	waded	and	swam	across	rivers,	set	up
rope	bridges,	and	with	our	hands	and	feet	shimmied	back	to	the	other	side."
Book 2,"We
couldn’t	stay	dry,	and	the	water	temperature	was	in	the	high	thirties	and	low
forties."
Book 2,"We’d	all	heard	the	story	that	during	the	winter	of	1994	it	got	so	cold,
four	would-be	Rangers	died	of	hypothermia	during	Florida	Phase."
Book 2,"Being	near	the
beach,	freezing	my	nuts	off,	reminded	me	of	Hell	Week."
Book 2,"Whenever	we	stopped,
guys	were	nut	to	butt	and	jackhammering,	but	as	usual,	I	focused	hard	and
refused	to	show	any	weakness."
Book 2,"This	time	it	wasn’t	about	taking	the	souls	of	our
instructors."
Book 2,It	was	about	giving	courage	to	the	men	who	were	struggling.
Book 2,"I’d
cross	the	river	six	times	if	that’s	what	it	took	to	help	one	of	my	guys	tie	off	his
rope	bridge."
Book 2,"I’d	walk	them	step-by-step	through	the	process	until	they	could
prove	their	value	to	the	Ranger	brass."
Book 2,"We	slept	very	little,	ate	even	less,	and	continually	knocked	off	reconnaissance
tasks,	hitting	waypoints,	setting	up	bridges	and	weapons,	and	preparing	for
ambush,	while	taking	turns	leading	a	group	of	fifty	men."
Book 2,"Those	men	were	tired,
hungry,	cold,	frustrated,	and	they	did	not	want	to	be	there	anymore."
Book 2,"Most	were	at
their	ultimate	edge,	their	100	percent."
Book 2,"I	was	getting	there	too,	but	even	when	it
wasn’t	my	turn	to	lead,	I	helped	out	because	in	those	sixty-nine	days	of	Ranger
School	I	learned	that	if	you	want	to	call	yourself	a	leader,	that’s	what	it	takes."
Book 2,"A	true	leader	stays	exhausted,	abhors	arrogance,	and	never	looks	down	on	the
weakest	link."
Book 2,He	fights	for	his	men	and	leads	by	example.
Book 2,"That’s	what	it	meant
to	be	uncommon	among	uncommon."
Book 2,"It	meant	being	one	of	the	best	and	helping
your	men	find	their	best	too."
Book 2,"It	was	a	lesson	I’d	wish	sunk	in	a	lot	deeper,
because	in	just	a	few	more	weeks	I’d	be	challenged	in	the	leadership	department
and	come	up	well	short."
Book 2,"Ranger	School	was	so	demanding,	and	the	standards	were	so	high	that	only
ninety-six	men	graduated	out	of	a	class	of	308	candidates,	and	the	majority	of
them	were	from	Bravo	platoon."
Book 2,"I	was	awarded	Enlisted	Honor	Man	and	received
a	100	percent	peer	evaluation."
Book 2,"To	me	that	meant	even	more,	because	my
classmates,	my	fellow	knuckle	draggers,	had	valued	my	leadership	in	harsh
conditions,	and	one	look	in	the	mirror	revealed	just	how	harsh	those	conditions
were.Certificate	for	being	the	Enlisted	Honor	Man	at	Ranger	School
I	lost	fifty-six	pounds	in	Ranger	School."
Book 2,I	looked	like	death.
Book 2,"My	cheeks	were
sunken."
Book 2,My	eyes	bugged	out.
Book 2,I	had	no	bicep	muscle	left.
Book 2,"All	of	us	were
emaciated."
Book 2,Guys	had	trouble	running	down	the	block.
Book 2,"Men	who	could	do	forty
pull-ups	in	one	go	now	struggled	to	do	a	single	one."
Book 2,"The	Army	expected	that	and
scheduled	three	days	between	the	end	of	Florida	Phase	and	graduation	to	fatten
us	up	before	our	families	flew	in	to	celebrate."
Book 2,"As	soon	as	the	final	FTX	was	called,	we	hustled	straight	to	chow	hall."
Book 2,"I	piled	my
tray	with	doughnuts,	fries,	and	cheeseburgers,	and	went	looking	for	the	milk
machine."
Book 2,"After	drinking	all	those	damn	chocolate	shakes	when	I	was	down	and
out,	my	body	had	become	lactose	intolerant,	and	I	hadn’t	touched	dairy	in	years."
Book 2,"But	that	day	I	was	like	a	little	child,	unable	to	stifle	a	primordial	yearning	for	a
glass	of	milk."
Book 2,"I	found	the	milk	machine,	pulled	the	lever	down	and	watched,	confused,	as	it
funneled	out,	chunky	as	cottage	cheese."
Book 2,I	shrugged	and	sniffed.
Book 2,"It	smelled	all
kinds	of	wrong,	but	I	remember	downing	that	spoiled	milk	like	it	was	a	fresh
glass	of	sweet	tea,	courtesy	of	another	hellacious	special	forces	school	that	put
us	through	so	much,	by	the	end	anybody	who	survived	was	grateful	for	their
cold	glass	of	spoiled	milk."
Book 2,"***
Most	people	take	a	couple	weeks	off	to	recover	from	Ranger	School	and	put
some	weight	back	on."
Book 2,Most	people	do	that.
Book 2,"The	day	of	graduation,	on
Valentine’s	Day,	I	flew	into	Coronado	to	meet	up	with	my	second	platoon."
Book 2,"Once
again,	I	looked	at	that	lack	of	lag	time	as	an	opportunity	to	be	uncommon."
Book 2,"Not
that	anybody	else	was	watching,	but	when	it	comes	to	mindset,	it	doesn’t	matter
where	other	people’s	attention	lies."
Book 2,"I	had	my	own	uncommon	standards	to	live
up	to."
Book 2,"At	every	stop	I’d	made	in	the	SEALs,	from	BUD/S	to	that	first	platoon	to
Ranger	School,	I	was	known	as	a	hard	motherfucker,	and	when	the	OIC	in	my
second	platoon	put	me	in	charge	of	PT,	I	was	encouraged	because	it	told	me	that
once	again	I’d	landed	with	a	group	of	men	who	were	driven	to	put	out	and	get
better."
Book 2,"Inspired,	I	bent	my	brain	to	think	of	evil	shit	we	could	do	to	get	us	battleready."
Book 2,"This	time	we	all	knew	we’d	deploy	to	Iraq,	and	I	made	it	my	mission	to
help	us	become	the	hardest	SEAL	platoon	in	the	fight."
Book 2,"That	was	a	high	bar,	set
by	the	original	Navy	SEAL	legend	still	lodged	like	an	anchor	deep	in	my	brain."
Book 2,"Our	legend	suggested	we	were	the	type	of	men	to	swim	five	miles	on	Monday,
run	twenty	miles	on	Tuesday,	and	climb	a	14,000-foot	peak	on	Wednesday,	and
my	expectations	were	sky	fucking	high."
Book 2,"For	the	first	week,	guys	rallied	at	5	a.m.	for	a	run-swim-run	or	a	twelve-mile
ruck,	followed	by	a	lap	through	the	O-Course."
Book 2,"We	carried	logs	over	the	berm
and	hammered	hundreds	of	push-ups."
Book 2,"I	had	us	doing	the	hard	shit,	the	real	shit,
the	workouts	that	made	us	SEALs.	Each	day	the	workouts	were	harder	than	the
last	and	over	the	course	of	a	week	or	two,	that	wore	people	down."
Book 2,"Every	alpha
male	in	special	ops	wants	to	be	the	best	at	everything	they	do,	but	with	me
leading	PT	they	couldn’t	always	be	the	best."
Book 2,Because	I	never	gave	them	a	break.
Book 2,We	were	all	breaking	down	and	showing	weakness.
Book 2,"That	was	the	idea,	but	they
didn’t	want	to	be	challenged	like	that	every	day."
Book 2,"During	the	second	week,
attendance	flagged	and	the	OIC	and	the	Chief	of	our	platoon	took	me	aside."
Book 2,"“Look,	dude,”	our	OIC	said,	“this	is	stupid."
Book 2,"What	are	we	doing?”
“We	aren’t	in	BUD/S	anymore,	Goggins,”	said	the	Chief."
Book 2,"To	me,	this	wasn’t	about	being	in	BUD/S,	this	was	about	living	the	SEAL	ethos
and	earning	the	Trident	every	day."
Book 2,"These	guys	wanted	to	do	their	own	PT,	which
typically	meant	hitting	the	gym	and	getting	big."
Book 2,"They	weren’t	interested	in	being
punished	physically,	and	definitely	weren’t	interested	in	being	pushed	to	meet
my	standard."
Book 2,"Their	reaction	shouldn’t	have	surprised	me,	but	it	sure	as	hell
disappointed	me	and	made	me	lose	all	respect	for	their	leadership."
Book 2,"I	understood	that	not	everyone	wanted	to	work	out	like	an	animal	for	the	rest	of
their	career,	because	I	didn’t	want	to	do	that	shit	either!	But	what	put	distance
between	me	and	almost	everybody	else	in	that	platoon	is	that	I	didn’t	let	my
desire	for	comfort	rule	me."
Book 2,"I	was	determined	to	go	to	war	with	myself	to	find
more	because	I	believed	it	was	our	duty	to	maintain	a	BUD/S	mentality	and
prove	ourselves	every	day."
Book 2,"Navy	SEALs	are	revered	the	world	over	and	are
thought	to	be	the	hardest	men	that	God	ever	created,	but	that	conversation	made
me	realize	that	wasn’t	always	true.I	had	just	come	from	Ranger	School,	a	place	where	nobody	has	any	rank	at	all."
Book 2,"Even	if	a	General	had	classed	up,	he’d	have	been	in	the	same	clothes	we	all	had
to	wear,	that	of	an	enlisted	man	on	day	one	of	basic	fucking	training."
Book 2,"We	were
all	maggots	reborn,	with	no	future	and	no	past,	starting	at	zero."
Book 2,"I	loved	that
concept	because	it	sent	a	message	that	no	matter	what	we’d	accomplished	in	the
outside	world,	as	far	as	the	Rangers	were	concerned	we	weren’t	shit."
Book 2,"And	I
claimed	that	metaphor	for	myself,	because	it’s	always	and	forever	true."
Book 2,"No
matter	what	you	or	I	achieve,	in	sports,	business,	or	life,	we	can’t	be	satisfied."
Book 2,Life	is	too	dynamic	a	game.
Book 2,We’re	either	getting	better	or	we’re	getting	worse.
Book 2,"Yes,	we	need	to	celebrate	our	victories."
Book 2,"There’s	power	in	victory	that’s
transformative,	but	after	our	celebration	we	should	dial	it	down,	dream	up	new
training	regimens,	new	goals,	and	start	at	zero	the	very	next	day."
Book 2,"I	wake	up	every
day	as	if	I	am	back	in	BUD/S,	day	one,	week	one."
Book 2,"Starting	at	zero	is	a	mindset	that	says	my	refrigerator	is	never	full,	and	it	never
will	be."
Book 2,"We	can	always	become	stronger	and	more	agile,	mentally	and
physically."
Book 2,We	can	always	become	more	capable	and	more	reliable.
Book 2,"Since	that’s
the	case	we	should	never	feel	that	our	work	is	done."
Book 2,There	is	always	more	to	do.
Book 2,Are	you	an	experienced	scuba	diver?
Book 2,"Great,	shed	your	gear,	take	a	deep	breath
and	become	a	one-hundred-foot	free	diver."
Book 2,Are	you	a	badass	triathlete?
Book 2,"Cool,
learn	how	to	rock	climb."
Book 2,Are	you	enjoying	a	wildly	successful	career?
Book 2,"Wonderful,	learn	a	new	language	or	skill."
Book 2,Get	a	second	degree.
Book 2,"Always	be
willing	to	embrace	ignorance	and	become	the	dumb	fuck	in	the	classroom	again,
because	that	is	the	only	way	to	expand	your	body	of	knowledge	and	body	of
work."
Book 2,It’s	the	only	way	to	expand	your	mind.
Book 2,"During	week	two	of	my	second	platoon,	my	Chief	and	OIC	showed	their	cards."
Book 2,"It	was	devastating	to	hear	that	they	didn’t	feel	that	we	needed	to	earn	our	status
every	day."
Book 2,"Sure,	all	the	guys	I	worked	with	over	the	years	were	relatively	hard
guys	and	highly	skilled."
Book 2,"They	enjoyed	the	challenges	of	the	job,	the	brotherhood,
and	being	treated	like	superstars."
Book 2,"They	all	loved	being	SEALs,	but	some	weren’t
interested	in	starting	at	zero	because	just	by	qualifying	to	breathe	rare	air	they
were	already	satisfied."
Book 2,"Now,	that	is	a	very	common	way	of	thinking."
Book 2,"Most
people	in	the	world,	if	they	ever	push	themselves	at	all,	are	willing	to	push
themselves	only	so	far."
Book 2,"Once	they	reach	a	cushy	plateau,	they	chill	the	fuck	out
and	enjoy	their	rewards,	but	there’s	another	phrase	for	that	mentality."
Book 2,"It’s	called
getting	soft,	and	that	I	could	not	abide.As	far	as	I	was	concerned	I	had	my	own	reputation	to	uphold,	and	when	the	rest
of	the	platoon	opted	out	of	my	custom	made	hellscape,	the	chip	on	my	shoulder
grew	even	bigger."
Book 2,"I	ramped	up	my	workouts	and	vowed	to	put	out	so	hard	it
would	hurt	their	fucking	feelings."
Book 2,"As	head	of	PT,	that	was	not	in	my	job
description."
Book 2,I	was	supposed	to	inspire	guys	to	give	more.
Book 2,"Instead,	I	saw	what	I
considered	a	glaring	weakness	and	let	them	know	I	wasn’t	impressed."
Book 2,"In	one	short	week,	my	leadership	regressed	light	years	from	where	I	was	in
Ranger	School."
Book 2,"I	lost	touch	with	my	situational	awareness	(SA)	and	didn’t
respect	the	men	in	my	platoon	enough."
Book 2,"As	a	leader,	I	was	trying	to	bull	my	way
through,	and	they	bucked	against	that."
Book 2,"Nobody	gave	an	inch,	including	the
officers."
Book 2,I	suppose	all	of	us	took	a	path	of	least	resistance.
Book 2,"I	just	didn’t	notice	it
because	physically	I	was	going	harder	than	ever."
Book 2,And	I	had	one	guy	with	me.
Book 2,"Sledge	was	a	hard	motherfucker	who	grew	up	in
San	Bernardino,	the	son	of	a	firefighter	and	a	secretary,	and,	like	me,	he	taught
himself	to	swim	in	order	to	pass	the	swim	test	and	qualify	for	BUD/S."
Book 2,"He	was
only	a	year	older	but	was	already	in	his	fourth	platoon."
Book 2,"He	was	also	a	heavy
drinker,	a	little	overweight,	and	looking	to	change	his	life."
Book 2,"The	morning	after	the
Chief,	the	OIC,	and	I	had	words,	Sledge	showed	up	at	5	a.m.	ready	to	roll."
Book 2,"I’d
been	there	since	4:30	a.m.	and	had	a	lather	of	sweat	working	already."
Book 2,"“I	like	what	you’re	doing	with	the	workouts,”	he	said,	“and	I	wanna	keep	doing
them.”
“Roger	that.”
From	then	on,	no	matter	where	we	were	stationed,	whether	that	was	Coronado,
Niland,	or	Iraq,	we	got	after	it	every	single	morning."
Book 2,"We’d	meet	up	at	4	a.m.	and
get	to	it."
Book 2,"Sometimes	that	meant	running	up	the	side	of	a	mountain	before	hitting
the	O-Course	at	high	speed	and	carrying	logs	up	and	over	the	berm	and	down	the
beach."
Book 2,"In	BUD/S,	usually	six	men	carried	those	logs."
Book 2,"We	did	it	with	just	the	two
of	us."
Book 2,"On	another	day	we	rocked	a	pull-up	pyramid,	hitting	sets	of	one,	all	the
way	up	to	twenty,	and	back	down	to	one	again."
Book 2,"After	every	other	set	we’d	climb
a	rope	forty	feet	high."
Book 2,"One	thousand	pull-ups	before	breakfast	became	our	new
mantra."
Book 2,"At	first,	Sledge	struggled	to	rock	one	set	of	ten	pull-ups."
Book 2,"Within	months
he’d	lost	thirty-five	pounds	and	was	hitting	one	hundred	sets	of	ten!In	Iraq,	it	was	impossible	to	get	long	runs	in,	so	we	lived	in	the	weight	room."
Book 2,"We
did	hundreds	of	deadlifts	and	spent	hours	on	the	hip	sled."
Book 2,"We	went	way	beyond
overtraining."
Book 2,"We	didn’t	care	about	muscle	fatigue	or	breakdown	because	after	a
certain	point	we	were	training	our	minds,	not	our	bodies."
Book 2,"My	workouts	weren’t
designed	to	make	us	fast	runners	or	to	be	the	strongest	men	on	the	mission."
Book 2,"I	was
training	us	to	take	torture	so	we’d	remain	relaxed	in	extraordinarily
uncomfortable	environments."
Book 2,And	shit	did	get	uncomfortable	from	time	to	time.
Book 2,Despite	the	clear	divide	within	our	platoon	(Sledge	and	me	vs.
Book 2,"everyone	else)	we
operated	well	together	in	Iraq."
Book 2,"Off	duty,	however,	there	was	a	huge	gulf	between
who	the	two	of	us	were	becoming	and	who	I	thought	the	men	in	my	platoon
were,	and	my	disappointment	showed."
Book 2,"I	wore	my	shitty	attitude	around	like	a
shroud,	thus	earning	me	the	platoon	nickname	David	“Leave	Me	Alone”
Goggins,	and	never	woke	up	to	realize	that	my	disappointment	was	my	own
problem."
Book 2,"Not	my	teammates’	fault.Platoon	dynamics	aside,	there	was	still	a	job	to	do	in	Iraq
That’s	the	drawback	of	becoming	uncommon	amongst	uncommon."
Book 2,"You	can
push	yourself	to	a	place	that	is	beyond	the	current	capability	or	temporal	mindset
of	the	people	you	work	with,	and	that’s	okay."
Book 2,"Just	know	that	your	supposed
superiority	is	a	figment	of	your	own	ego."
Book 2,"So	don’t	lord	it	over	them,	because	it
won’t	help	you	advance	as	a	team	or	as	an	individual	in	your	field."
Book 2,"Instead	of
getting	angry	that	your	colleagues	can’t	keep	up,	help	pick	your	colleagues	up
and	bring	them	with	you!
We	are	all	fighting	the	same	battle."
Book 2,"All	of	us	are	torn	between	comfort	and
performance,	between	settling	for	mediocrity	or	being	willing	to	suffer	in	order
to	become	our	best	self,	all	the	damn	time."
Book 2,"We	make	those	kinds	of	decisions	a
dozen	or	more	times	each	day."
Book 2,"My	job	as	head	of	PT	wasn’t	to	demand	that	my
guys	live	up	to	the	Navy	SEAL	legend	I	loved,	it	was	to	help	them	become	the
best	version	of	themselves."
Book 2,"But	I	never	listened,	and	I	didn’t	lead."
Book 2,"Instead,	I	got
angry	and	showed	up	my	teammates."
Book 2,"For	two	years	I	played	the	tough	guy	and
never	took	a	step	back	with	a	calm	mind	to	address	my	original	error."
Book 2,"I	had
countless	opportunities	to	bridge	the	gap	I’d	helped	create,	but	I	never	did,	and	it
cost	me."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	realize	any	of	that	right	away,	because	after	my	second	platoon,	I	was
ordered	to	freefall	school,	then	made	an	assaults	instructor."
Book 2,"Both	were	posts
scheduled	to	prep	me	for	Green	Team."
Book 2,"Assaults	was	critical	because	most	people
who	get	cut	from	Green	Team	are	dismissed	for	sloppy	house	runs."
Book 2,"They	move
too	slow	when	clearing	buildings,	are	too	easily	exposed,	or	are	amped	up	and
trigger	happy	and	end	up	shooting	friendly	targets."
Book 2,"Teaching	those	skills	made
me	clinical,	stealthy,	and	calm	in	confined	environments,	and	I	expected	to
receive	my	orders	to	train	with	DEVGRU	in	Dam	Neck,	Virginia,	any	day,	but
they	never	came."
Book 2,"The	other	two	guys	who’d	rocked	the	screening	with	me
received	their	orders."
Book 2,Mine	went	AWOL.
Book 2,I	called	leadership	at	Dam	Neck.
Book 2,"They	told	me	to	screen	again,	and	that’s	when	I
knew	something	was	off."
Book 2,I	thought	about	the	process	I’d	been	through.
Book 2,"Did	I
really	expect	to	do	better?"
Book 2,I	smoked	that	shit.
Book 2,"But	then	I	remembered	the	actual
interview,	which	felt	more	like	an	interrogation	with	two	men	playing	good	cop,
bad	cop."
Book 2,They	didn’t	probe	my	skillset	or	Navy	knowhow.
Book 2,"Eighty-five	percent	of
their	questions	had	nothing	to	do	with	my	ability	to	operate	whatsoever."
Book 2,Thebulk	of	that	interview	was	about	my	race.
Book 2,"“We	are	a	bunch	of	good	ol’	boys,”	one	of	them	said,	“and	we	need	to	know
how	you’re	gonna	handle	hearing	black	jokes,	bro.”
Most	of	their	questions	were	a	variation	on	that	one	theme	and	through	it	all,	I
smiled	and	thought,	How	are	you	white	boys	gonna	feel	when	I’m	the	baddest
motherfucker	in	here?"
Book 2,"But	that’s	not	what	I	said,	and	it	wasn’t	because	I	was
intimidated	or	uncomfortable."
Book 2,"I	was	more	at	home	in	that	interview	than
anywhere	I’d	been	in	the	military,	because	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	it	was	out
in	the	fucking	open."
Book 2,"They	weren’t	trying	to	pretend	that	being	one	of	only	a
handful	of	black	guys	in	perhaps	the	most	revered	military	organization	in	the
world	didn’t	have	its	own	unique	set	of	challenges."
Book 2,"One	guy	was	challenging	me
with	his	aggressive	posture	and	tone,	the	other	guy	kept	it	cool,	but	they	were
both	being	real."
Book 2,"There	were	two	or	three	black	men	in	DEVGRU	already	and
they	were	telling	me	that	entry	into	their	inner	circle	required	my	signing	off	on
certain	terms	and	conditions."
Book 2,"And	in	a	sick	way,	I	loved	that	message	and	the
challenge	that	came	with	it."
Book 2,"DEVGRU	was	a	hard	ass,	renegade	crew	within	the	SEALs,	and	they	wanted	it
to	stay	that	way."
Book 2,They	didn’t	want	to	civilize	anybody.
Book 2,"They	didn’t	want	to
evolve	or	change,	and	I	knew	where	I	was	and	what	I	was	getting	myself	into."
Book 2,"This	crew	was	responsible	for	the	most	dangerous,	tip	of	the	spear	missions."
Book 2,"It
was	a	white	man’s	underworld,	and	these	guys	needed	to	know	how	I’d	act	if
someone	started	to	fuck	with	me."
Book 2,"They	needed	assurances	I	could	control	my
emotions,	and	once	I	saw	through	their	language	into	the	greater	purpose,	I
couldn’t	be	offended	by	their	act."
Book 2,"“Look,	I’ve	experienced	racism	my	entire	life,”	I	replied,	“and	there	is	nothing
any	of	you	fuckers	can	say	to	me	that	I	haven’t	heard	twenty	times	before,	but	be
ready."
Book 2,"Because	I’m	coming	right	the	fuck	back	at	you!”	At	the	time,	they	seemed
to	like	the	sound	of	that."
Book 2,"Trouble	is,	when	you’re	a	black	guy	giving	it	back	it
usually	doesn’t	go	over	nearly	as	well."
Book 2,"I	will	never	know	why	I	didn’t	receive	my	orders	for	Green	Team,	and	it	doesn’t
matter."
Book 2,We	can’t	control	all	the	variables	in	our	lives.
Book 2,"It’s	about	what	we	do	with
opportunities	revoked	or	presented	to	us	that	determine	how	a	story	ends."
Book 2,"Instead
of	thinking,	I	crushed	the	screening	process	once,	I	can	do	it	again,	I	decided	tostart	at	zero	and	screen	for	Delta	Force—the	Army’s	version	of	DEVGRU,
instead."
Book 2,"Delta	Selection	is	rigorous,	and	I’d	always	been	intrigued	by	it	due	to	the	elusive
nature	of	the	group."
Book 2,"Unlike	SEALs,	you	never	heard	about	Delta."
Book 2,"The	screening
for	Delta	Selection	included	an	IQ	test,	a	complete	military	resume	including	my
qualifications	and	war	experience,	and	my	evaluations."
Book 2,"I	pulled	all	of	that
together	in	a	few	days,	knowing	that	I	was	competing	against	the	best	guys	from
every	military	branch	and	that	only	the	cream	would	be	extended	an	invitation."
Book 2,My	Delta	orders	came	through	in	a	matter	of	weeks.
Book 2,"Not	long	after	that,	I	landed
in	the	mountains	of	West	Virginia	ready	to	compete	for	a	spot	among	the
Army’s	very	best	soldiers."
Book 2,"Strangely,	there	was	no	yelling	or	screaming	in	the	Delta	void."
Book 2,"There	was	no
muster	and	no	OICs.	The	men	that	showed	up	there	were	all	self-starters	and	our
orders	were	chalked	on	a	board	hanging	in	the	barracks."
Book 2,"For	three	days	we
weren’t	allowed	to	leave	the	compound."
Book 2,"Our	focus	was	rest	and	acclimatization,
but	on	day	four,	PT	started	up	with	the	basic	screening	test,	which	included	two
minutes	of	push-ups,	two	minutes	of	sit-ups,	and	a	timed	two-mile	run."
Book 2,"They
expected	everyone	to	meet	a	minimum	standard,	and	those	that	didn’t	were	sent
home."
Book 2,From	there	things	got	immediately	and	progressively	more	difficult.
Book 2,"In
fact,	later	that	same	night	we	had	our	first	road	march."
Book 2,"Like	everything	in	Delta,
officially	the	distance	was	unknown,	but	I	believe	it	was	about	an	eighteen-mile
course	from	start	to	finish."
Book 2,"It	was	cold	and	very	dark	when	all	160	of	us	took	off,	strapped	with	around
forty-pound	rucksacks."
Book 2,"Most	guys	started	out	in	a	slow	march,	content	to	pace
themselves	and	hike	it	out."
Book 2,"I	took	off	hot,	and	in	the	first	quarter	mile	left
everyone	behind."
Book 2,"I	saw	an	opportunity	to	be	uncommon	and	seized	it,	and	I
finished	about	thirty	minutes	before	anybody	else."
Book 2,Delta	Selection	is	the	best	orienteering	course	in	the	world.
Book 2,"For	the	next	ten	days
we	hammered	PT	in	the	morning	and	worked	on	advanced	land	navigation	skills
into	the	night."
Book 2,"They	taught	us	how	to	get	from	A	to	B	by	reading	the	terrain
instead	of	roads	and	trails	on	a	map."
Book 2,"We	learned	to	read	fingers	and	cuts,	and
that	if	you	get	high	you	want	to	stay	high."
Book 2,We	were	taught	to	follow	water.
Book 2,"When	you	start	reading	the	land	this	way,	your	map	comes	alive,	and	for	the	first
time	in	my	life	I	became	great	at	orienteering."
Book 2,We	learned	to	judge	distance	andhow	to	draw	our	own	topographic	maps.
Book 2,"At	first	we	were	assigned	an	instructor
to	tail	through	the	wildlands,	and	those	instructors	hauled	ass."
Book 2,"For	the	next	few
weeks	we	were	on	our	own."
Book 2,"Technically,	we	were	still	practicing,	but	we	were
also	being	graded	and	watched	to	make	sure	we	were	moving	cross-country
instead	of	taking	roads."
Book 2,"It	all	culminated	with	an	extended	final	exam	in	the	field	that	lasted	seven	days
and	nights,	if	we	even	made	it	that	far."
Book 2,This	wasn’t	a	team	effort.
Book 2,"Each	of	us	was
on	our	own	to	use	our	map	and	compass	to	navigate	from	one	waypoint	to	the
next."
Book 2,"There	was	a	Humvee	at	every	stop	and	the	cadres	(our	instructors	and
evaluators)	there	noted	our	time	and	gave	us	the	next	set	of	coordinates."
Book 2,"Each
day	was	its	own	unique	challenge,	and	we	never	knew	how	many	points	we’d
have	to	navigate	before	the	test	was	done."
Book 2,"Plus,	there	was	an	unknown	time	limit
that	only	the	cadres	were	privy	to."
Book 2,"At	the	finish	line	we	weren’t	told	if	we	passed
or	failed."
Book 2,Instead	we	were	directed	to	one	of	two	covered	Humvees.
Book 2,"The	good
truck	took	you	to	the	next	camp,	the	bad	truck	motored	back	to	base,	where	you
would	have	to	pack	your	shit	and	head	home."
Book 2,"Most	of	the	time	I	didn’t	know	if	I
made	it	for	sure	until	the	truck	stopped."
Book 2,"By	day	five	I	was	one	of	roughly	thirty	guys	still	in	consideration	for	Delta
Force."
Book 2,"There	were	only	three	days	left	and	I	was	rocking	every	test,	coming	in	at
least	ninety-minutes	before	drop-dead	time."
Book 2,"The	final	test	would	be	a	forty-mile
ball-kicker	of	a	land	navigation,	and	I	was	looking	forward	to	that,	but	first	I	had
work	to	do."
Book 2,"I	splashed	through	washes,	huffed	up	sloped	woodlands,	and
rambled	along	ridgelines,	point-to-point	until	the	unthinkable	happened."
Book 2,"I	got
lost."
Book 2,I	was	on	the	wrong	ridge.
Book 2,"I	double	checked	my	map	and	compass	and
looked	across	a	valley	to	the	correct	one,	due	south."
Book 2,"Roger	that!
For	the	first	time,	the	clock	became	a	factor."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	the	drop-dead	time,
but	knew	I	was	cutting	it	close,	so	I	sprinted	down	a	steep	ravine	but	lost	my
footing."
Book 2,"My	left	foot	jammed	between	two	boulders,	I	rolled	over	my	ankle	and
felt	it	pop."
Book 2,The	pain	was	immediate.
Book 2,"I	checked	my	watch,	gritted	my	teeth,	and
laced	my	boot	tight	as	quickly	as	I	could,	then	hobbled	up	a	steep	hillside	to	the
correct	ridge."
Book 2,"On	the	final	stretch	to	the	finish,	my	ankle	blew	up	so	bad	I	had	to	untie	my	bootto	relieve	the	pain."
Book 2,"I	moved	slow,	convinced	I	would	be	sent	home."
Book 2,I	was	wrong.
Book 2,"My	Humvee	unloaded	us	at	the	second	to	last	base	camp	of	Delta	Selection,
where	I	iced	my	ankle	all	night	knowing	that	thanks	to	my	injury,	the	next	day’s
land	navigation	test	was	likely	beyond	my	capability."
Book 2,But	I	didn’t	quit.
Book 2,"I	showed
up,	fought	to	stay	in	the	mix,	but	missed	my	time	on	one	of	the	early	checkpoints
and	that	was	that."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	hang	my	head,	because	injuries	happen."
Book 2,"I’d	given	it
everything	I	had	and	when	you	handle	business	like	that,	your	effort	will	not	go
unnoticed."
Book 2,Delta	cadres	are	like	robots.
Book 2,"Throughout	Selection	they	didn’t	show	any
personality,	but	as	I	was	getting	ready	to	leave	the	compound,	one	of	the	officers
in	charge	called	me	into	his	office."
Book 2,"“Goggins,”	he	said,	extending	his	hand,	“you	are	a	stud!	We	want	you	to	heal
up,	come	back,	and	try	again."
Book 2,"We	believe	you	will	be	a	great	addition	to	Delta
Force	someday.”
But	when?"
Book 2,"I	came	to	from	my	second	heart	surgery	in	a	billowing	cloud	of
anesthesia."
Book 2,"I	looked	over	my	right	shoulder	to	an	IV	drip	and	followed	the	flow
to	my	veins."
Book 2,I	was	wired	to	the	medical	mind.
Book 2,"Beeping	heart	monitors	recorded
data	to	tell	a	story	in	a	language	beyond	my	comprehension."
Book 2,"If	only	I	were
fluent,	maybe	I’d	know	if	my	heart	was	finally	whole,	if	there	would	ever	be	a
“someday.”	I	placed	my	hand	over	my	heart,	closed	my	eyes	and	listened	for
clues."
Book 2,"After	leaving	Delta,	I	went	back	to	the	SEAL	Teams	and	was	assigned	to	land
warfare	as	an	instructor	instead	of	a	warrior."
Book 2,At	first	my	morale	flagged.
Book 2,"Men
who	lacked	my	skills,	commitment,	and	athletic	ability	were	in	the	field	in	two
countries	and	I	was	moored	in	no-man’s-land,	wondering	how	it	had	all	gone	so
haywire	so	quickly."
Book 2,"It	felt	like	I’d	hit	a	glass	ceiling,	but	had	it	always	been	there
or	did	I	slide	it	into	place	myself?"
Book 2,The	truth	was	somewhere	in	between.
Book 2,"I	realized	from	living	in	Brazil,	Indiana,	that	prejudice	is	everywhere."
Book 2,"There	is	a
piece	of	it	in	every	person	and	each	and	every	organization,	and	if	you	are	the
only	in	any	given	situation,	it’s	on	you	to	decide	how	you’re	going	to	handle	it
because	you	can’t	make	it	go	away."
Book 2,"For	years,	I	used	it	to	fuel	me	because
there’s	a	lot	of	power	in	being	the	only."
Book 2,"It	forces	you	to	juice	your	own	resources
and	to	believe	in	yourself	in	the	face	of	unfair	scrutiny."
Book 2,"It	increases	the	degree	ofdifficulty,	which	makes	every	success	that	much	sweeter."
Book 2,"That’s	why	I
continually	put	myself	in	situations	where	I	knew	I	would	encounter	it."
Book 2,"I	fed	off
being	the	only	one	in	a	room."
Book 2,"I	brought	the	war	to	people	and	watched	my
excellence	explode	small	minds."
Book 2,I	didn’t	sit	back	and	cry	about	being	the	only.
Book 2,"I
took	action,	said	go	fuck	yourself,	and	used	all	the	prejudice	I	felt	as	dynamite	to
blow	up	those	walls."
Book 2,But	that	kind	of	raw	material	will	only	get	you	so	far	in	life.
Book 2,"I	was	so
confrontational	I	created	needless	enemies	along	the	way,	and	I	believe	that’s
what	limited	my	access	to	the	top	SEAL	Teams."
Book 2,"With	my	career	at	a	crossroads,
I	didn’t	have	time	to	dwell	on	those	mistakes."
Book 2,"I	had	to	find	higher	ground	and
turn	the	negative	I’d	created	into	another	positive."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	just	accept	land
warfare	duty,	I	was	the	best	instructor	I	could	possibly	be,	and	on	my	own	time	I
created	new	opportunities	for	myself	by	launching	my	ultra	quest,	which	revived
my	stalled	career."
Book 2,"I	was	right	back	on	track	until	I	learned	I’d	been	born	with	a
broken	heart."
Book 2,Yet	there	was	a	positive	side	to	that	too.
Book 2,"Tucked	into	my	post-op	hospital	bed,	I
looked	to	be	fading	in	and	out	of	consciousness,	as	conversations	between
doctors,	nurses,	my	wife,	and	mother	bled	into	one	another	like	white	noise."
Book 2,"They	had	no	clue	that	I	was	wide	awake	the	whole	time,	listening	to	my
wounded	heart	beat,	and	smiling	inside."
Book 2,"Knowing	I	finally	had	definitive,
scientific	proof	that	I	was	as	uncommon	as	any	motherfucker	who	has	ever	lived.CHALLENGE	#9
This	one’s	for	the	unusual	motherfuckers	in	this	world."
Book 2,"A	lot	of	people	think	that
once	they	reach	a	certain	level	of	status,	respect,	or	success,	that	they’ve	made	it
in	life."
Book 2,I’m	here	to	tell	you	that	you	always	have	to	find	more.
Book 2,"Greatness	is	not
something	that	if	you	meet	it	once	it	stays	with	you	forever."
Book 2,"That	shit	evaporates
like	a	flash	of	oil	in	a	hot	pan."
Book 2,"If	you	truly	want	to	become	uncommon	amongst	the	uncommon,	it	will	require
sustaining	greatness	for	a	long	period	of	time."
Book 2,"It	requires	staying	in	constant
pursuit	and	putting	out	unending	effort."
Book 2,"This	may	sound	appealing	but	will
require	everything	you	have	to	give	and	then	some."
Book 2,"Believe	me,	this	is	not	for
everyone	because	it	will	demand	singular	focus	and	may	upset	the	balance	in
your	life."
Book 2,"That’s	what	it	takes	to	become	a	true	overachiever,	and	if	you	are	already
surrounded	by	people	who	are	at	the	top	of	their	game,	what	are	you	going	to	do
differently	to	stand	out?"
Book 2,"It’s	easy	to	stand	out	amongst	everyday	people	and	be	a
big	fish	in	a	small	pond."
Book 2,"It	is	a	much	more	difficult	task	when	you	are	a	wolf
surrounded	by	wolves."
Book 2,"This	means	not	only	getting	into	Wharton	Business	School,	but	being	ranked	#1
in	your	class."
Book 2,"It	means	not	just	graduating	BUD/S,	but	becoming	Enlisted	Honor
Man	in	Army	Ranger	School	then	going	out	and	finishing	Badwater."
Book 2,"Torch	the	complacency	you	feel	gathering	around	you,	your	coworkers,	and
teammates	in	that	rare	air."
Book 2,"Continue	to	put	obstacles	in	front	of	yourself,	because
that’s	where	you’ll	find	the	friction	that	will	help	you	grow	even	stronger."
Book 2,"Before	you	know	it,	you	will	stand	alone."
Book 2,"#canthurtme	#uncommonamongstuncommon.CHAPTER	TEN
10."
Book 2,"THE	EMPOWERMENT	OF	FAILURE
On	September	27,	2012,	I	stood	in	a	makeshift	gym	on	the	second	floor	of	30
Rockefeller	Center	prepared	to	break	the	world	record	for	pull-ups	in	a	twenty-
four-hour	period."
Book 2,"That	was	the	plan,	anyway."
Book 2,"Savannah	Guthrie	was	there,	along
with	an	official	from	the	Guinness	Book	of	World	Records	and	Matt	Lauer
(yeah,	that	fucking	guy)."
Book 2,"Again,	I	was	gunning	to	raise	money—a	lot	of	money
this	time—for	the	Special	Operations	Warrior	Foundation,	but	I	also	wanted	that
record."
Book 2,To	get	it	I	had	to	perform	under	The	Today	Show	spotlight.
Book 2,"The	number	in	my	head	was	4,020	pull-ups."
Book 2,"Sounds	superhuman,	right?"
Book 2,"Did	to
me	too,	until	I	dissected	it	and	realized	if	I	could	knock	out	six	pull-ups	on	the
minute,	every	minute,	for	twenty-four	hours,	I’d	shatter	it."
Book 2,"That’s	roughly	ten
seconds	of	effort,	and	fifty	seconds	of	rest,	each	minute."
Book 2,"It	wouldn’t	be	easy,	but
I	considered	it	doable	given	the	work	I’d	put	in."
Book 2,"Over	the	past	five	to	six	months,
I’d	rocked	over	40,000	pull-ups	and	was	stoked	to	be	on	the	precipice	of	another
huge	challenge."
Book 2,"After	all	the	ups	and	downs	since	my	second	heart	surgery,	I
needed	this."
Book 2,The	good	news	was	the	surgery	worked.
Book 2,"For	the	first	time	in	my	life	I	had	a	fully
functioning	heart	muscle,	and	I	wasn’t	in	a	rush	to	run	or	ride."
Book 2,"I	was	patient	with
my	recovery."
Book 2,"The	Navy	wouldn’t	clear	me	to	operate	anyway,	and	in	order	to
stay	in	the	SEALs	I	had	to	accept	a	non-deployable,	non-combat	job."
Book 2,"Admiral
Winters	kept	me	in	recruiting	for	two	more	years,	and	I	remained	on	the	road,
shared	my	story	with	willing	ears,	and	worked	to	win	hearts	and	minds."
Book 2,"But	all	I
really	wanted	to	do	was	what	I	was	trained	to	do,	and	that’s	fight!	I	tried	to	salve
that	wound	with	trips	to	the	gun	range,	but	shooting	targets	only	made	me	feel
worse."
Book 2,"In	2011,	after	recruiting	for	four-plus	years	and	spending	two	and	a	half	years	on
the	disabled	list	due	to	my	heart	issues,	I	was	finally	medically	cleared	to	operate
again."
Book 2,Admiral	Winters	offered	to	send	me	anywhere	I	wanted	to	go.
Book 2,"He	knew
my	sacrifices	and	my	dreams,	and	I	told	him	I	had	unfinished	business	withChosen	as	Sailor	of	the	Quarter,	January	to	March	2010
Once	again,	I	dropped	into	Appalachia	for	Delta	Selection."
Book 2,"In	2006,	after	I
smoked	the	eighteen-mile	road	ruck	on	our	first	real	day	of	work,	I	heard	some
well-intentioned	blowback	from	some	of	the	other	guys	who	were	tapped	into
the	rumor	mill."
Book 2,In	Delta	Selection	everything	is	a	secret.
Book 2,"Yes,	there	are	clear
tasks	and	training	but	nobody	tells	you	how	long	the	tasks	are	or	will	be	(even
the	eighteen-mile	ruck	was	a	best	estimate	based	on	my	own	navigation),	and
only	the	cadres	know	how	they	evaluate	their	candidates."
Book 2,"According	to	the
rumor	mill,	they	use	that	first	ruck	as	a	baseline	to	calculate	how	long	each
navigation	task	should	take."
Book 2,"Meaning	if	you	go	hard	you’ll	eat	away	at	your	own
margin	for	error."
Book 2,"This	time,	I	had	that	intel	going	in,	and	I	could	have	played	it
safe	and	taken	my	time,	but	I	wasn’t	about	to	go	out	among	those	great	men	and
give	a	half-assed	effort."
Book 2,"I	went	out	even	harder	so	I	could	make	sure	they	saw
my	very	best,	and	I	broke	my	own	course	record	(according	to	that	reliable
rumor	mill)	by	nine	minutes."
Book 2,"Rather	than	hear	it	from	me,	I	reached	out	to	one	of	the	guys	who	was	in	Delta
Selection	with	me,	and	below	is	his	first-hand	account	of	how	that	ruck	went
down:
Before	I	can	talk	about	the	road	march,	I	have	to	give	a	little	bit	of	context
in	the	days	leading	up	to	it."
Book 2,"Showing	up	to	Selection	you	have	no	idea	what
to	expect,	everyone	hears	stories	but	you	do	not	have	a	complete	grasp	of
what	you	are	about	to	go	through…I	remember	arriving	at	an	airport
waiting	for	a	bus	and	everyone	was	hanging	out	bullshitting."
Book 2,"For	many
people	it	is	a	reunion	of	friends	that	you	haven’t	seen	in	years."
Book 2,"This	is	also
where	you	start	sizing	everyone	up."
Book 2,"I	remember	a	majority	of	the	people
talking	or	relaxing,	there	was	one	person	who	was	sitting	on	his	bag,
looking	intense."
Book 2,"That	person	I	would	later	find	out	was	David	Goggins,	you
could	tell	right	from	the	start	he	would	be	one	of	the	guys	at	the	end."
Book 2,"Being
a	runner,	I	recognized	him,	but	didn’t	really	put	it	all	together	until	after	the
first	few	days."
Book 2,"There	are	several	events	that	you	know	you	have	to	do	just	to	start	the
course;	one	of	those	is	the	road	march."
Book 2,"Without	getting	into	specific
distances,	I	knew	it	was	going	to	be	fairly	far	but	was	comfortable	withrunning	a	majority	of	it."
Book 2,"Coming	into	Selection,	I	had	been	in	Special
Forces	for	a	majority	of	my	career	and	it	was	rare	when	someone	finished
before	me	in	a	road	march."
Book 2,I	was	comfortable	with	a	ruck	on	my	back.
Book 2,"When	we	started	it	was	a	little	cold	and	very	dark,	and	as	we	took	off	I	was
where	I	was	most	comfortable,	out	front."
Book 2,"Within	the	first	quarter	mile	a	guy
blew	by	me,	I	thought	to	myself,	“No	way	he	could	keep	that	pace.”	But	I
could	see	the	light	on	his	headlamp	continue	to	pull	away;	I	figured	I	would
see	him	in	a	few	miles	after	the	course	crushed	him."
Book 2,"This	particular	road	march	course	has	a	reputation	of	being	brutal;	there
was	one	hill	that	as	I	was	going	up	I	could	almost	reach	out	in	front	of	me
and	touch	the	ground,	it	was	that	steep."
Book 2,"At	this	point,	there	was	only	one
guy	in	front	of	me	and	I	saw	footprints	that	were	twice	as	long	as	my	stride
length."
Book 2,"I	was	in	awe,	my	exact	thought	was,	“This	is	the	craziest	shit	I	have
seen;	that	dude	ran	up	this	hill.”	Throughout	the	next	couple	of	hours,	I	was
expecting	to	come	around	a	corner	and	find	him	laid	up	on	the	side	of	the
road,	but	that	never	happened."
Book 2,"Once	finished,	I	was	laying	out	my	gear	and
I	saw	David	hanging	out."
Book 2,He	had	been	done	for	quite	a	while.
Book 2,"Though
Selection	is	an	individual	event,	he	was	the	first	to	give	a	high	five	and	say,
“Nice	work.”
—T,	in	an	email	dated	06/25/2018
That	performance	left	an	impression	beyond	the	guys	in	my	Selection	class."
Book 2,"I
heard	recently	from	Hawk,	another	SEAL,	that	some	Army	guys	he	worked	with
on	deployment	were	still	talking	about	that	ruck,	almost	like	it	is	an	urban
legend."
Book 2,"From	there	I	continued	to	smash	through	Delta	Selection	at	or	near	the
top	of	the	class."
Book 2,"My	land	navigation	skills	were	better	than	they’d	ever	been,	but
that	doesn’t	mean	it	was	easy."
Book 2,"Roads	were	off	limits,	there	was	no	flat	ground,
and	for	days	we	bushwhacked	up	and	down	steep	slopes,	in	below-freezing
temperatures,	taking	waypoints,	reading	maps,	and	the	countless	peaks,	ridges,
and	draws	that	all	looked	the	same."
Book 2,"We	moved	through	thick	brush	and	deep
snow	banks,	splashed	through	icy	creeks,	and	slalomed	the	winter	skeletons	of
towering	trees."
Book 2,"It	was	painful,	challenging,	and	fucking	beautiful,	and	I	was
smoking	it,	mashing	every	test	they	could	conjure."
Book 2,"On	the	second	to	last	day	of	Delta	Selection,	I	hit	my	first	four	points	as	fast	as
usual."
Book 2,"Most	days	there	were	five	waypoints	to	hit	in	total,	so	when	I	got	my	fifthI	was	beyond	confident."
Book 2,"In	my	mind,	I	was	the	black	Daniel	Boone."
Book 2,"I	plotted	my
point	and	moseyed	down	another	steep	grade."
Book 2,"One	way	to	navigate	foreign
terrain	is	to	track	power	lines,	and	I	could	see	that	one	of	those	lines	in	the
distance	led	directly	to	my	fifth,	and	final	point."
Book 2,"I	hustled	down	country,	tracked
the	line,	turned	my	conscious	mind	off,	and	started	dreaming	ahead."
Book 2,"I	knew	I
was	going	to	rock	the	final	exam—that	forty-mile	land	navigation	I	didn’t	even
get	to	attempt	last	time	because	I	busted	my	ankle	two	days	before."
Book 2,"I	considered
my	graduation	a	foregone	conclusion,	and	after	that	I’d	be	running	and	gunning
in	an	elite	unit	again."
Book 2,"As	I	visualized	it,	it	became	all	the	more	real,	and	my
imagination	took	me	far	away	from	the	Appalachian	Mountains."
Book 2,"The	thing	about	following	the	power	supply	is	you’d	better	make	damn	sure
you’re	on	the	right	line!	According	to	my	training,	I	was	supposed	to	be
constantly	checking	my	map,	so	if	I	made	a	misstep	I	could	re-adjust	and	head	in
the	right	direction	without	losing	too	much	time,	but	I	was	so	overconfident	I
forgot	to	do	that,	and	I	didn’t	chart	backstops	either."
Book 2,"By	the	time	I	woke	from
fantasy	land,	I	was	way	off	course	and	almost	out	of	bounds!
I	went	into	panic	mode,	found	my	location	on	the	map,	humped	it	to	the	right
power	line,	sprinted	to	the	top	of	the	mountain	and	kept	running	all	the	way	to
my	fifth	point."
Book 2,"I	still	had	ninety	minutes	until	drop-dead	time	but	when	I	got
close	to	the	next	Humvee	I	saw	another	guy	heading	back	toward	me!
“Where	you	headed,”	I	asked	as	I	jogged	over."
Book 2,"“I’m	off	to	my	sixth	point,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“Shit,	there’s	not	five	points	today?!”
“Nah,	there’s	six	today,	brother.”
I	checked	my	watch."
Book 2,I	had	a	little	over	forty	minutes	before	they	called	time.
Book 2,"I
reached	the	Humvee,	took	down	the	coordinates	for	checkpoint	six	and	studied
the	map."
Book 2,"Thanks	to	my	fuck	up,	I	had	two	clear	options."
Book 2,"I	could	play	by	the	rules
and	miss	drop-dead	time	or	I	could	break	the	rules,	use	the	roads	at	my	disposal,
and	give	myself	a	chance."
Book 2,"The	one	thing	on	my	side	was	that	in	special
operations	they	prize	a	thinking	shooter,	a	soldier	willing	to	do	what	it	takes	to
meet	an	objective."
Book 2,All	I	could	do	was	hope	they’d	have	mercy	on	me.
Book 2,I	plottedthe	best	possible	route	and	took	the	fuck	off.
Book 2,"I	skirted	the	woods,	used	the	roads,
and	whenever	I	heard	a	truck	rumbling	in	the	near	distance,	I	took	cover."
Book 2,"A	half
hour	later,	at	the	crest	of	yet	another	mountain,	I	could	see	the	sixth	point,	our
finish	line."
Book 2,"According	to	my	watch,	I	had	five	minutes	left."
Book 2,"I	flew	downhill,	sprinting	all	out,	and	made	drop-dead	by	one	minute."
Book 2,"As	I
caught	my	breath,	our	crew	was	divided	and	loaded	into	the	covered	beds	of	two
separate	Humvees."
Book 2,"At	first	glance,	my	group	of	guys	looked	pretty	squared
away,	but	given	when	and	where	I	received	my	sixth	point,	every	cadre	in	the
place	had	to	know	I’d	skirted	protocol."
Book 2,I	didn’t	know	what	to	think.
Book 2,"Was	I	still	in
or	assed	out?"
Book 2,"At	Delta	Selection,	one	way	to	be	sure	you’re	out	is	if	you	feel	speed	bumps
after	a	day’s	work."
Book 2,"Speed	bumps	mean	you’re	back	at	the	base,	and	you’re
heading	home	early."
Book 2,"That	day,	when	we	felt	the	first	one	jar	us	out	of	our	hopes
and	dreams,	some	guys	started	cursing,	others	had	tears	in	their	eyes."
Book 2,"I	just
shook	my	head."
Book 2,"“Goggins,	what	the	fuck	are	you	doing	here?”	One	guy	asked."
Book 2,"He	was	shocked
to	see	me	sitting	alongside	him,	but	I	was	resigned	to	my	reality	because	I’d
been	daydreaming	about	graduating	Delta	training	and	being	a	part	of	the	force

mistake.”
I	appreciated	his	outrage."
Book 2,"I	expected	to	make	it	too,	but	I	couldn’t	be	upset	by
their	decision."
Book 2,"Delta	brass	weren’t	looking	for	men	who	could	pass	a	class	with	a
C,	B+,	or	even	an	A-	effort."
Book 2,"They	only	accepted	A+	students,	and	if	you	fucked
up	and	delivered	a	performance	that	was	below	your	capability	they	sent	you
packing."
Book 2,"Shit,	if	you	daydream	for	a	split	second	on	the	battlefield,	that	could
mean	your	life	and	the	life	of	one	of	your	brothers."
Book 2,I	understood	that.
Book 2,"“No.	It	was	my	mistake,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“I	got	this	far	by	staying	focused	and	delivering
my	best,	and	I’m	going	home	because	I	lost	focus.”***
It	was	time	to	go	back	to	being	a	SEAL."
Book 2,"For	the	next	two	years	I	based	in
Honolulu	as	part	of	a	clandestine	transport	unit	called	SDV,	for	SEAL	Delivery
Vehicles."
Book 2,"Operation	Red	Wings	is	the	best	known	SDV	mission,	and	you	only
heard	about	it	because	it	was	such	big	news."
Book 2,"Most	SDV	work	happens	in	the
shadows,	and	well	out	of	sight."
Book 2,"I	fit	in	well	over	there,	and	it	was	great	to	be
back	operating	again."
Book 2,"I	lived	on	Ford	Island,	with	a	view	of	Pearl	Harbor	right
out	my	living	room	window."
Book 2,"Kate	and	I	had	split	up,	so	now	I	was	really	living
that	Spartan	life,	and	still	waking	up	at	5	a.m.	to	run	into	work."
Book 2,"I	had	two	routes,
an	eight-miler	and	a	ten-miler,	but	no	matter	which	I	took	my	body	didn’t	react
too	well."
Book 2,"After	only	a	few	miles,	I’d	feel	intense	neck	pain	and	dizzy	spells."
Book 2,"There	were	several	times	during	my	runs	that	I	would	have	to	sit	down	due	to
vertigo."
Book 2,"For	years	I’d	harbored	a	suspicion	that	we	all	had	a	limit	on	the	miles	we	could
run	before	a	full-body	breakdown,	and	I	wondered	if	I	was	closing	in	on	mine."
Book 2,My	body	had	never	felt	so	tight.
Book 2,"I	had	a	knot	on	the	base	of	my	skull	that	I	first
noticed	after	graduating	BUD/S."
Book 2,A	decade	later	it	had	doubled	in	size.
Book 2,"I	had
knots	above	my	hip	flexors	too."
Book 2,"I	went	to	the	doctor	to	get	everything	checked
out,	but	they	weren’t	even	tumors,	much	less	malignant."
Book 2,"When	the	doctors
cleared	me	of	mortal	danger,	I	realized	I’d	have	to	live	with	them	and	try	to
forget	about	long-distance	running	for	a	while."
Book 2,"When	an	activity	or	exercise	that	you’ve	always	relied	on	gets	taken	away	from
you,	like	running	was	for	me,	it’s	easy	to	get	stuck	in	a	mental	rut	and	stop	doing
any	exercise	at	all,	but	I	didn’t	have	a	quitter’s	mentality."
Book 2,"I	gravitated	toward	the
pull-up	bar	and	replicated	the	workouts	I	used	to	do	with	Sledge."
Book 2,"It	was	an
exercise	that	allowed	me	to	push	myself	and	didn’t	make	me	dizzy	because	I
could	take	a	break	between	sets."
Book 2,"After	a	while	I	Googled	around	to	see	if	there
was	a	pull-up	record	within	reach."
Book 2,"That’s	when	I	read	about	Stephen	Hyland’s
many	pull-up	records,	including	the	twenty-four-hour	record	of	4,020."
Book 2,"At	the	time	I	was	known	as	an	ultra	runner,	and	I	didn’t	want	to	be	known	for
just	one	thing."
Book 2,Who	does?
Book 2,"Nobody	thought	of	me	as	an	all-around	athlete,	and
this	record	could	change	that	dynamic."
Book 2,"How	many	people	are	capable	of	running
100,	150,	even	200	miles	and	also	knocking	out	over	4,000	pull-ups	in	a	day?"
Book 2,"I
called	the	Special	Operations	Warrior	Foundation	and	asked	if	I	could	help	raisea	bit	more	money."
Book 2,"They	were	thrilled,	and	next	thing	I	knew,	a	contact	of	mine
used	her	networking	skills	to	book	me	on	the	damn	Today	Show."
Book 2,"To	prepare	for	the	attempt	I	did	400	pull-ups	a	day	during	the	week,	which	took
me	about	seventy	minutes."
Book 2,"On	Saturday	I	did	1,500	pull-ups,	in	sets	of	five	to	ten
reps	over	three	hours,	and	on	Sunday	I	dialed	it	back	to	750."
Book 2,"All	that	work
strengthened	my	lats,	triceps,	biceps,	and	back,	prepared	my	shoulder	and	elbow
joints	to	take	extreme	punishment,	helped	me	develop	a	powerful	gorilla-type
grip,	and	built	up	my	lactic	acid	tolerance	so	my	muscles	could	still	function
long	after	they	were	overworked."
Book 2,"As	game	day	approached,	I	shortened	recovery
and	started	doing	five	pull-ups	every	thirty	seconds	for	two	hours."
Book 2,"Afterward	my
arms	fell	to	my	side,	limp	as	overstretched	rubber	bands."
Book 2,"On	the	eve	of	my	record	attempt,	my	mom	and	uncle	flew	into	New	York	City	to
help	crew	me,	and	we	were	all	systems	go	until	the	SEALs	nearly	killed	my
Today	Show	appearance	at	the	last	minute."
Book 2,"No	Easy	Day,	a	first-hand	account	of
the	Osama	Bin	Laden	raid,	had	just	come	out."
Book 2,"It	was	written	by	one	of	the
operators	in	the	DEVGRU	unit	that	got	it	done,	and	Naval	Special	Warfare	brass
were	not	happy."
Book 2,"Special	Operators	are	not	supposed	to	share	details	of	the	work
we	do	in	the	field	with	the	general	public,	and	lots	of	people	in	the	Teams
resented	that	book."
Book 2,"I	was	given	a	direct	order	to	pull	out	of	the	appearance,
which	didn’t	make	any	sense."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	going	on	camera	to	talk	about	operations,
and	I	wasn’t	on	a	mission	to	self-promote."
Book 2,"I	wanted	to	raise	one	million	dollars
for	families	of	the	fallen,	and	The	Today	Show	was	the	biggest	morning	show	on
television."
Book 2,"I’d	served	in	the	military	for	nearly	twenty	years	by	that	point,	without	a	single
infraction	on	my	record,	and	for	the	previous	four	years	the	Navy	had	used	me	as
their	poster	boy."
Book 2,"They	put	me	on	billboards,	I	was	interviewed	on	CNN,	and	I’d
jumped	out	of	an	airplane	on	NBC."
Book 2,"They	placed	me	in	dozens	of	magazine	and
newspaper	stories,	which	helped	their	recruitment	mission."
Book 2,"Now	they	were
trying	to	stifle	me	for	no	good	reason."
Book 2,"Hell,	if	anybody	knew	the	regulations	of
what	I	could	and	could	not	say	it	was	me."
Book 2,"In	the	nick	of	time,	the	Navy’s	legal
department	cleared	me	to	proceed.“What	should	we	cook	for	you	tomorrow	once	it’s	all	over?”	Savannah	Guthrie
replied."
Book 2,"I	laughed	and	played	along,	agreeable	as	hell,	but	don’t	get	it	twisted,	I
was	way	out	of	my	comfort	zone."
Book 2,"I	was	about	to	go	to	war	with	myself,	but	I
didn’t	look	like	it	or	act	like	it."
Book 2,"As	the	clock	wound	down	I	took	my	shirt	off	and
was	wearing	only	a	pair	of	lightweight,	black	running	shorts	and	running	shoes."
Book 2,"“Wow,	it’s	like	looking	at	myself	in	a	mirror,”	Lauer	joked,	gesturing	toward
me."
Book 2,"“This	segment	just	got	even	more	interesting,”	said	Savannah."
Book 2,"“All	right	David,
best	of	luck	to	you."
Book 2,"We	will	be	watching.”
Someone	hit	play	on	Going	the	Distance,	the	Rocky	theme	song,	and	I	stepped	to
the	pull-up	bar."
Book 2,"It	was	painted	matte	black,	wrapped	with	white	tape,	and
stenciled	with	the	phrase,	SHOW	NO	WEAKNESS	in	white	lettering."
Book 2,"I	got	the
last	word	in	as	I	strapped	on	my	gray	gloves."
Book 2,"“Please	donate	to	specialops.org,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“We’re	trying	to	raise	a	million
dollars.”
“Alright,	are	you	ready?”	Lauer	asked."
Book 2,"“Three…two…one…David,	go!”
With	that,	the	clock	started	and	I	rocked	a	set	of	eight	pull-ups."
Book 2,"The	rules	laid
down	by	the	Guinness	Book	of	World	Records	were	clear."
Book 2,"I	had	to	start	each
pull-up	from	a	dead	hang	with	arms	fully	extended,	and	my	chin	had	to	exceed
the	bar."
Book 2,"“So	it	begins,”	Savannah	said."
Book 2,"I	smiled	for	the	camera	and	looked	relaxed,	but	even	those	first	pull-ups	didn’t
feel	right."
Book 2,Part	of	it	was	situational.
Book 2,"I	was	a	lone	fish	in	a	glass	box	aquarium	that
attracted	sunshine	and	reflected	a	bank	of	hot	show	lights."
Book 2,"The	other	half	was
technical."
Book 2,"From	the	very	first	pull-up	I	noticed	that	the	bar	had	a	lot	more	give
than	I	was	used	to."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	have	my	usual	power	and	anticipated	a	long	fucking
day."
Book 2,"At	first,	I	blocked	that	shit	out."
Book 2,Had	to.
Book 2,"A	looser	bar	just	meant	a	stronger
effort	and	gave	me	another	opportunity	to	be	uncommon."
Book 2,"Throughout	the	day	people	passed	by	on	the	street	below,	waved,	and	cheered."
Book 2,"I
waved	back,	kept	to	my	plan,	and	rocked	six	pull-ups	on	the	minute,	every	damnminute,	but	it	wasn’t	easy	because	of	that	rickety	bar."
Book 2,"My	force	was	getting
dissipated,	and	after	hundreds	of	pull-ups,	dissipation	took	its	toll."
Book 2,"Each
subsequent	pull-up	required	a	monumental	effort,	a	stronger	grip,	and	at	the
1,500	mark	my	forearms	hurt	like	hell."
Book 2,"My	massage	therapist	rubbed	them	down
between	sets,	but	they	bulged	with	lactic	acid	which	seeped	into	every	muscle	in
my	upper	body."
Book 2,"After	more	than	six	long	hours,	and	with	2,000	pull-ups	in	the	bank,	I	took	my
first	ten-minute	break."
Book 2,"I	was	well	ahead	of	my	twenty-four-hour	pace,	and	the
sun	angled	lower	on	the	horizon,	which	reduced	the	mercury	in	the	room	to
manageable."
Book 2,It	was	late	enough	that	the	whole	studio	was	shut	down.
Book 2,"It	was	just
me,	a	few	friends,	a	massage	therapist,	and	my	mother."
Book 2,"Today	Show	cameras
were	set	up	and	rolling	to	clock	me	and	make	sure	I	kept	to	regulations."
Book 2,"I	had
more	than	2,000	pull-ups	still	to	go,	and	for	the	first	time	that	day,	doubt	carved
out	a	home	in	my	brain."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	vocalize	my	negativity,	and	I	tried	to	reset	my	mind	for	the	second	half
push,	but	the	truth	was	my	whole	plan	had	gone	to	hell."
Book 2,"My	carbohydrate	drink
wasn’t	giving	me	the	power	I	needed,	and	I	didn’t	have	a	Plan	B,	so	I	ordered
and	downed	a	cheeseburger."
Book 2,It	felt	good	to	have	some	real	food.
Book 2,"Meanwhile,	my
team	tried	to	stabilize	the	bar	by	tying	it	to	the	pipes	in	the	rafters,	but	instead	of
recharging	my	system	like	I’d	hoped,	the	long	break	had	an	adverse	effect.During	first	pull-up	record	attempt
My	body	was	shutting	down,	while	my	mind	swirled	with	panic	because	I’d
made	a	pledge	and	staked	my	name	on	a	quest	to	raise	money	and	break	a
record,	and	I	already	knew	that	there	was	no	way	on	this	earth	I	was	gonna	be
able	to	get	it	done."
Book 2,"It	took	me	five	hours	to	do	another	500	pull-ups—that’s	an
average	of	under	two	pull-ups	per	minute."
Book 2,"I	was	verging	on	total	muscle	failure
after	doing	only	1,000	more	pull-ups	than	I	would	rock	in	three	hours	at	the	gym
on	a	typical	Saturday	with	no	ill	effects."
Book 2,How	was	that	possible?
Book 2,"I	tried	to	bull	my	way	through,	but	tension	and	lactic	acid	had	overwhelmed	mysystem	and	my	upper	body	was	a	lump	of	dough."
Book 2,"I	had	never	hit	muscle	failure
before	in	my	life."
Book 2,"I’d	run	on	broken	legs	in	BUD/S,	run	nearly	a	hundred	miles
on	broken	feet,	and	accomplished	dozens	of	physical	feats	with	a	hole	in	my
heart."
Book 2,"But	late	at	night,	on	the	second	floor	of	the	NBC	tower,	I	pulled	the	plug."
Book 2,"After	my	2,500th	pull-up,	I	could	barely	lift	my	hands	high	enough	to	grip	the
bar,	let	alone	clear	it	with	my	chin,	and	just	like	that,	it	was	over."
Book 2,"There	would
be	no	celebratory	breakfast	with	Savannah	and	Matt."
Book 2,"There	would	be	no
celebration	at	all."
Book 2,"I	failed,	and	I’d	failed	in	front	of	millions	of	people."
Book 2,So	did	I	hang	my	head	in	shame	and	misery?
Book 2,"Fuck	no!	To	me	a	failure	is	just	a
stepping	stone	to	future	success."
Book 2,"The	next	morning,	my	phone	was	blowing	up
so	I	left	it	in	my	hotel	room	and	went	for	a	run	in	Central	Park."
Book 2,"I	needed	zero
distractions	and	time	enough	to	go	back	through	what	I’d	done	well	and	where
I’d	fallen	short."
Book 2,"In	the	military,	after	every	real-world	mission	or	field	exercise,
we	fill	out	After	Action	Reports	(AARs),	which	serve	as	live	autopsies."
Book 2,"We	do
them	no	matter	the	outcome,	and	if	you’re	analyzing	a	failure	like	I	was,	the
AAR	is	absolutely	crucial."
Book 2,"Because	when	you’re	headed	into	uncharted	territory
there	are	no	books	to	study,	no	YouTube	instructional	videos	to	watch."
Book 2,"All	I	had
to	read	were	my	mistakes,	and	I	considered	all	variables."
Book 2,"First	of	all,	I	should	never	have	gone	on	that	show."
Book 2,My	motivation	was	solid.
Book 2,"It
was	a	good	idea	to	try	to	increase	awareness	and	raise	money	for	the	foundation,
and	while	I	required	exposure	to	raise	the	amount	I’d	hoped,	by	thinking	of
money	first	(always	a	bad	idea)	I	wasn’t	focused	on	the	task	at	hand."
Book 2,"To	break
this	record,	I	needed	an	optimal	environment,	and	that	realization	blasted	me	like
a	surprise	attack."
Book 2,I	didn’t	respect	the	record	enough	going	in.
Book 2,"I	thought	I	could
have	broken	it	on	a	rusty	bar	bolted	to	the	back	of	a	pick-up	truck	with	loose
shocks,	so	even	though	I	tested	the	bar	twice	before	game	day,	it	never	bothered
me	enough	to	make	a	change,	and	my	lack	of	focus	and	attention	to	detail	cost
me	a	shot	at	immortality."
Book 2,"There	were	also	way	too	many	bubbly	looky-loos
buzzing	in	and	out	of	the	room,	asking	for	pictures	between	sets."
Book 2,"This	was	the
beginning	of	the	selfie	era,	and	that	sickness	most	definitely	invaded	my
motherfucking	safe	space."
Book 2,"Obviously,	my	break	was	too	long."
Book 2,"I	figured	massage	would	counteract	the
swelling	and	lactic	acid	build-up,	but	I	was	wrong	about	that	too,	and	I	should
have	taken	more	salt	tablets	to	prevent	cramping."
Book 2,"Before	my	attempt,	haters
found	me	online	and	predicted	my	failure,	but	I	ignored	them	and	didn’t	fullyabsorb	the	hard	truths	couched	in	their	negativity."
Book 2,"I	thought,	as	long	as	I	trained
hard,	the	record	would	be	mine,	and	as	a	result,	I	wasn’t	as	well-prepared	as	I
should	have	been."
Book 2,"You	can’t	prepare	for	unknown	factors,	but	if	you	have	a	better	pre-game	focus,
you	will	likely	only	have	to	deal	with	one	or	two	rather	than	ten."
Book 2,"In	New	York,
too	many	bubbled	up,	and	unknown	factors	usually	blaze	a	wake	of	doubt."
Book 2,"Afterward,	I	was	eye	to	eye	with	my	haters	and	acknowledged	that	my	margin
for	error	was	small."
Book 2,"I	weighed	210	pounds,	much	heavier	than	anyone	else	who
had	ever	tried	to	break	that	record,	and	my	probability	of	failure	was	high."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	touch	a	pull-up	bar	for	two	weeks,	but	once	back	in	Honolulu	I
hammered	sets	at	my	home	gym	and	noticed	the	difference	in	the	bar	right	way."
Book 2,"Still,	I	had	to	resist	the	temptation	to	blame	everything	on	that	loose	bar	because
odds	were	that	a	firmer	one	wouldn’t	translate	into	an	extra	1,521	pull-ups."
Book 2,"I
researched	gymnast	chalk,	gloves,	and	taping	systems."
Book 2,"I	sampled	and
experimented."
Book 2,"This	time	I	wanted	a	fan	set	below	the	bar	to	cool	me	down
between	sets,	and	I	switched	up	my	nutrition."
Book 2,"Instead	of	running	off	pure	carbs	I
added	in	some	protein	and	bananas	to	prevent	cramping."
Book 2,"When	it	came	time	to
choose	a	location	to	attempt	the	record,	I	knew	I	needed	to	get	back	to	who	I	am
at	my	core."
Book 2,That	meant	losing	the	glitz	and	setting	up	shop	in	a	dungeon.
Book 2,"And	on
a	trip	to	Nashville,	I	found	just	the	place,	a	Crossfit	gym	a	mile	from	my
mother’s	house,	owned	by	a	former	marine	named	Nandor	Tamaska."
Book 2,"After	emailing	a	couple	of	times,	I	ran	over	to	Crossfit	Brentwood	Hills	to	meet
him."
Book 2,"It	was	set	in	a	strip	mall,	a	few	doors	down	from	a	Target,	and	there	was
nothing	fancy	about	the	place."
Book 2,"It	had	black	mat	floors,	buckets	of	chalk,	racks	of
iron,	and	lots	of	hard	motherfuckers	doing	work."
Book 2,"When	I	walked	in,	the	first
thing	I	did	was	grab	the	pull-up	bar	and	shake	it."
Book 2,"It	was	bolted	into	the	ground
just	like	I’d	hoped."
Book 2,"Even	a	little	sway	in	the	bar	would	require	me	to	adjust	my
grip	mid-set,	and	when	your	goal	is	4,021	pull-ups,	all	minuscule	movements
accumulate	into	a	reservoir	of	wasted	energy,	which	takes	a	toll."
Book 2,"“This	is	exactly	what	I	need,”	I	said,	gripping	the	bar."
Book 2,"“Yeah,”	Nandor	said."
Book 2,"“They	have	to	be	sturdy	to	double	as	our	squat	racks.”
In	addition	to	its	strength	and	stability,	it	was	the	right	height."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	want	ashort	bar,	because	bending	your	legs	can	cause	cramping	in	the	hamstrings."
Book 2,"I
needed	it	high	enough	that	I	could	grab	it	when	standing	on	my	toes."
Book 2,I	could	tell	right	away	that	Nandor	was	a	perfect	co-conspirator	for	this	mission.
Book 2,"He	had	been	an	enlisted	man,	got	into	Crossfit,	and	moved	to	Nashville	from
Atlanta	with	his	wife	and	family	to	open	his	first	gym."
Book 2,"Not	many	people	are
willing	to	open	their	doors	and	let	a	stranger	take	over	their	gym,	but	Nandor
was	down	with	the	Warrior	Foundation	cause."
Book 2,"My	second	attempt	was	scheduled	for	November,	and	for	five	straight	weeks	I
did	500-1,300	pull-ups	a	day	at	my	home	gym	in	Hawaii."
Book 2,"During	my	last	island
session,	I	did	2,000	pull-ups	in	five	hours,	then	caught	a	flight	to	Nashville,
arriving	six	days	before	my	attempt."
Book 2,Nandor	rallied	members	of	his	gym	to	act	as	witnesses	and	my	support	crew.
Book 2,"He
took	care	of	the	playlist,	sourced	the	chalk,	and	set	up	a	break	room	in	back	in
case	I	needed	it."
Book 2,He	also	put	out	a	press	release.
Book 2,"I	trained	at	his	gym	in	the	run-up
to	game	day,	and	a	local	news	channel	came	by	to	file	a	report."
Book 2,"The	local
newspaper	did	a	story	too."
Book 2,"It	was	small	scale,	but	Nashville	was	growing
curious,	especially	the	Crossfit	junkies."
Book 2,Several	showed	up	to	absorb	the	scene.
Book 2,"I
spoke	with	Nandor	recently,	and	I	liked	how	he	put	it."
Book 2,"“People	have	been	running	for	decades,	and	running	long	distances,	but	4,000
pull-ups,	the	human	body	isn’t	designed	to	do	that."
Book 2,"So	to	get	a	chance	to	witness
something	like	that	was	pretty	neat.”
I	rested	the	full	day	before	the	attempt	and	when	I	showed	up	to	the	gym	I	felt
strong	and	prepared	for	the	minefield	ahead."
Book 2,"Nandor	and	my	mom	collaborated
to	have	everything	dialed	in."
Book 2,"There	was	a	sleek	digital	timer	on	the	wall	which
also	tracked	my	count,	plus	they	had	two	battery-powered	wall	clocks	running	as
back	ups."
Book 2,"There	was	a	Guinness	Book	of	World	Records	banner	hanging	over
the	bar,	and	a	video	crew	because	every	rep	had	to	be	recorded	for	potential
review."
Book 2,My	tape	was	right.
Book 2,My	gloves	perfect.
Book 2,"The	bar	was	bolted	solid,	and
when	I	started	out,	my	performance	was	explosive."
Book 2,The	numbers	remained	the	same.
Book 2,"I	was	gunning	for	six	pull-ups	every	minute,
on	the	minute,	and	during	the	first	ten	sets	I	rose	up	chest	high."
Book 2,"Then	I
remembered	my	game	plan	to	minimize	needless	movement	and	wasted	energy.On	my	initial	attempt	I	felt	pressure	to	get	my	chin	well	over	the	bar,	but	while
all	that	extra	space	made	for	a	good	show,	it	did	not	and	would	not	help	me	get
the	damn	record."
Book 2,"This	time	I	told	myself	to	barely	clear	the	bar	with	my	chin,
and	not	to	use	my	arms	and	hands	for	anything	other	than	pull-ups."
Book 2,"Instead	of
reaching	down	for	my	water	bottle	like	I	had	in	New	York,	I	set	it	on	a	stack	of
wooden	boxes	(the	kind	used	for	box	jumps),	so	all	I	had	to	do	was	turn	and	suck
my	nutrition	through	a	straw."
Book 2,"The	first	sip	triggered	me	to	dial	back	my	pull-up
motion	and	from	then	on,	I	remained	disciplined	as	I	piled	up	numbers."
Book 2,"I	was	on
my	game	and	confident	as	hell."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	thinking	of	just	4,020	pull-ups."
Book 2,"I	wanted
to	go	the	full	twenty-four	hours."
Book 2,"If	I	did	that,	5,000	was	possible,	or	even	6,000!
I	remained	hyper	vigilant,	scanning	for	any	physical	issues	that	could	crop	up
and	derail	the	attempt."
Book 2,"All	was	smooth	until,	after	almost	four	hours	and	1,300
pull-ups,	my	hands	started	to	blister."
Book 2,"In	between	sets	my	mom	hit	me	with
Second	Skin	so	I	could	stay	on	top	of	the	cuts."
Book 2,"This	was	a	new	problem	for	me,
and	I	remembered	all	the	doubting	comments	I’d	read	on	social	media	prior	to
my	attempt."
Book 2,"My	arms	were	too	long,	they	said."
Book 2,I	weighed	too	much.
Book 2,"My	form
wasn’t	ideal,	I	put	too	much	pressure	on	my	hands."
Book 2,"I’d	disregarded	that	last
comment	because	during	my	first	attempt	I	didn’t	have	palm	issues,	but	in	the
midst	of	my	second	I	realized	it	was	because	the	first	bar	had	so	much	give."
Book 2,"This
time	I	had	more	stability	and	power,	but	over	time	that	hard-ass	bar	did	damage."
Book 2,"Still,	I	labored	on	and	after	1,700	pull-ups	my	forearms	started	aching,	and	when
I	bent	my	arms,	my	biceps	pinched	too."
Book 2,"I	remembered	those	sensations	from	my
first	go	’round."
Book 2,"It	was	the	beginning	of	cramps,	so	between	sets	I	downed	salt
tablets	and	ate	two	bananas,	and	that	took	care	of	my	muscular	discomfort."
Book 2,"My
palms	just	kept	getting	worse."
Book 2,"A	hundred	and	fifty	pull-ups	later	I	could	feel	them	splitting	down	the	middle
beneath	my	gloves."
Book 2,"I	knew	I	should	stop	and	try	to	fix	the	problem,	but	I	also
knew	that	might	trigger	my	body	to	stiffen	up	and	shut	down."
Book 2,"I	was	fighting	two
fires	at	once	and	didn’t	know	where	to	strike	first."
Book 2,"I	opted	to	stay	on	the	minute
by	minute	pace,	and	in	between	experimented	with	different	solutions."
Book 2,"I	wore
two	pairs	of	gloves,	then	three."
Book 2,"I	resorted	to	my	old	friend,	duct	tape."
Book 2,"Didn’t
help."
Book 2,I	couldn’t	wrap	the	bar	in	pads	because	that	was	against	Guinness	rules.
Book 2,"All
I	could	do	was	try	anything	and	everything	to	stay	in	the	fight."
Book 2,"Ten	hours	into	the	attempt,	I	hit	a	wall."
Book 2,I	was	down	to	three	pull-ups	a	minute	onthe	minute.
Book 2,The	pain	was	excruciating	and	I	needed	some	relief.
Book 2,"I	took	my	right
glove	off."
Book 2,Layers	of	skin	came	off	with	it.
Book 2,My	palm	looked	like	raw	hamburger.
Book 2,"My	mom	called	a	doctor	friend,	Regina,	who	lived	nearby	and	the	two	of	us
went	into	the	back	room	to	wait	for	her	and	try	to	salvage	my	record	attempt."
Book 2,"When	Regina	showed	up	she	evaluated	the	situation,	pulled	out	a	syringe,	loaded
it	with	local	anesthetic	and	dipped	the	needle	toward	the	open	wound	on	my
right	hand."
Book 2,"My	hand	during	the	second	pull-up	record	attempt
She	looked	over."
Book 2,"My	heart	pounded,	sweat	saturated	every	inch	of	my	skin."
Book 2,"I
could	feel	my	muscles	cooling	down	and	stiffening	up,	but	I	nodded,	turned
away,	and	she	sunk	that	needle	in	deep."
Book 2,"It	hurt	so	fucking	bad,	but	I	held	my
primal	scream	inside."
Book 2,"Show	no	weakness	remained	my	motto,	but	that	didn’t
mean	I	felt	strong."
Book 2,"My	mom	pulled	off	my	left	glove,	anticipating	the	second
shot,	but	Regina	was	busy	examining	the	swelling	in	my	biceps	and	the	bulging
spasms	in	my	forearms."
Book 2,"“You	look	like	you’re	in	rhabdomyolysis,	David,”	she	said."
Book 2,"“You	shouldn’t
continue."
Book 2,"It’s	dangerous.”	I	had	no	idea	what	the	fuck	she	was	talking	about,	so
she	broke	it	down."
Book 2,"There’s	a	phenomenon	that	happens	when	one	muscle	group	is	worked	way	too
hard	for	way	too	long."
Book 2,"The	muscles	become	starved	of	glucose	and	break	down,
leaking	myoglobin,	a	fibrous	protein	that	stores	oxygen	in	the	muscle,	into	the
bloodstream."
Book 2,"When	that	happens,	it’s	up	to	the	kidneys	to	filter	all	those	proteins
out	and	if	they	become	overwhelmed,	they	shut	down."
Book 2,"“People	can	die	from
rhabdo,”	she	said.My	hands	throbbed	with	agony."
Book 2,"My	muscles	were	locking	up,	and	the	stakes
couldn’t	be	higher."
Book 2,"Any	rational	person	would	have	thrown	in	the	towel,	but	I
could	hear	Going	the	Distance	booming	from	the	speakers,	and	knew	that	this
was	my	14th	round,	Cut	me,	Mick,	moment."
Book 2,Fuck	rationality.
Book 2,I	held	up	my	left	palm	and	had	Regina	sink	her	needle	in.
Book 2,"Waves	of	pain	washed	through	me	as	a	bumper	crop	of	doubt	flowered	in	my
mind."
Book 2,"She	wrapped	both	palms	in	layers	of	gauze	and	medical	tape	and	fitted	me
with	a	fresh	pair	of	gloves."
Book 2,"Then	I	stalked	back	out	onto	the	gym	floor	and	got
back	to	work."
Book 2,"I	was	at	2,900,	and	as	long	as	I	remained	in	the	fight,	I	still
believed	anything	was	possible."
Book 2,"I	did	sets	of	twos	and	threes	on	the	minute	for	two	hours,	but	it	felt	like	I	was
gripping	a	red	hot,	melting	rod,	which	meant	I	was	down	to	using	my	fingertips
to	grip	the	bar."
Book 2,"First	I	used	four	fingers,	then	three."
Book 2,"I	was	able	to	gut	out	one
hundred	more	pull-ups,	then	one	hundred	more."
Book 2,Hours	ticked	by.
Book 2,"I	crept	closer
but	with	my	body	in	rhabdo,	breakdown	was	imminent."
Book 2,"I	did	several	sets	of	pull-
ups	with	my	wrists	dangling	over	the	bar."
Book 2,"It	sounds	impossible,	but	I	managed
until	the	numbing	agents	stopped	working."
Book 2,"Then	even	bending	my	fingers	felt
like	I	was	stabbing	myself	in	the	hand	with	a	sharp	knife."
Book 2,"After	eclipsing	3,200	pull-ups,	I	worked	out	the	math	and	realized	if	I	could	do
800	sets	of	one,	it	would	take	thirteen	hours	and	change	to	break	the	record	and	I
would	just	beat	the	clock."
Book 2,I	lasted	forty-five	minutes.
Book 2,"The	pain	was	too	much	and
the	vibe	in	the	room	went	from	optimistic	to	somber."
Book 2,"I	was	still	trying	to	show	as
little	weakness	as	I	could,	but	the	volunteers	could	see	me	messing	with	my
gloves	and	grip,	and	knew	something	was	drastically	wrong."
Book 2,"When	I	went	into
the	back	to	regroup	a	second	time	I	heard	a	collective	sigh	that	sounded	like
doom."
Book 2,"Regina	and	my	mother	unwrapped	the	tape	on	my	hands,	and	I	could	feel	my
flesh	peeling	like	a	banana."
Book 2,"Both	palms	were	filleted	open	down	to	the	dermis,
which	is	where	our	nerves	lie."
Book 2,"Achilles	had	his	heel,	and	when	it	came	to	pull-
ups,	my	gift,	and	my	undoing,	were	my	hands."
Book 2,The	doubters	were	right.
Book 2,"I	wasn’t
one	of	those	lightweight,	graceful	pull-up	guys."
Book 2,"I	was	powerful,	and	the	power
came	from	my	grip."
Book 2,"But	now	my	hand	better	resembled	a	physiology	mannequin
than	something	human.Emotionally,	I	was	wasted."
Book 2,"Not	just	because	of	my	sheer	physical	exhaustion	or
because	I	couldn’t	get	the	record	for	myself,	but	because	so	many	people	had
come	out	to	help."
Book 2,"I’d	taken	over	Nandor’s	gym	and	felt	like	I’d	disappointed
everyone."
Book 2,"Without	a	word,	my	mother	and	I	slipped	out	the	back	door	like	we
were	escaping	a	crime	scene,	and	as	she	drove	to	the	hospital,	I	couldn’t	stop
thinking,	I’m	better	than	this!
While	Nandor	and	his	team	broke	down	the	clocks,	untied	the	banners,	swept	up
chalk,	and	peeled	bloody	tape	off	their	pull-up	bar,	my	mom	and	I	slumped	into
chairs	in	the	ER	waiting	room."
Book 2,I	was	holding	what	was	left	of	my	glove.
Book 2,"It
looked	like	it	was	lifted	from	the	OJ	Simpson	crime	scene,	like	it	had	been
marinated	in	blood."
Book 2,She	eyeballed	me	and	shook	her	head.
Book 2,"“Well,”	she	said,	“I	know	one	thing…”
After	a	long	pause	I	turned	to	face	her."
Book 2,"“What’s	that?”
“You’re	gonna	do	this	again.”
She	read	my	damn	mind."
Book 2,"I	was	already	doing	my	live	autopsy	and	would	run
through	a	complete	AAR	on	paper	as	soon	as	my	bloody	hands	would	allow."
Book 2,"I
knew	there	was	treasure	in	this	wreckage	and	leverage	to	be	gained	somewhere."
Book 2,I	just	had	to	piece	it	together	like	a	puzzle.
Book 2,"And	the	fact	that	she	realized	that
without	my	saying	so	fired	me	up."
Book 2,A	lot	of	us	surround	ourselves	with	people	who	speak	to	our	desire	for	comfort.
Book 2,"Who	would	rather	treat	the	pain	of	our	wounds	and	prevent	further	injury	than
help	us	callous	over	them	and	try	again."
Book 2,"We	need	to	surround	ourselves	with
people	who	will	tell	us	what	we	need	to	hear,	not	what	we	want	to	hear,	but	at
the	same	time	not	make	us	feel	we’re	up	against	the	impossible."
Book 2,"My	mother	was
my	biggest	fan."
Book 2,"Whenever	I	failed	in	life	she	was	always	asking	me	when	and
where	I	would	go	after	it	again."
Book 2,"She	never	said,	Well,	maybe	it	isn’t	meant	to	be."
Book 2,"Most	wars	are	won	or	lost	in	our	own	heads,	and	when	we’re	in	a	foxhole	we
usually	aren’t	alone,	and	we	need	to	be	confident	in	the	quality	of	the	heart,
mind,	and	dialogue	of	the	person	hunkered	down	with	us."
Book 2,Because	at	some	pointwe	will	need	some	empowering	words	to	keep	us	focused	and	deadly.
Book 2,"In	that
hospital,	in	my	own	personal	foxhole,	I	was	swimming	in	doubt."
Book 2,"I	fell	800	pull-
ups	short	and	I	knew	what	800	pull-ups	felt	like."
Book 2,"That’s	a	long	fucking	day!	But
there	was	nobody	else	I’d	rather	have	been	in	that	foxhole	with."
Book 2,"“Don’t	worry,”	she	said."
Book 2,"“I’ll	start	calling	those	witnesses	up	as	soon	as	we	get
home.”
“Roger	that,”	I	said."
Book 2,"“Tell	them	I’ll	be	back	on	that	bar	in	two	months.”
***
In	life,	there	is	no	gift	as	overlooked	or	inevitable	as	failure."
Book 2,"I’ve	had	quite	a	few
and	have	learned	to	relish	them,	because	if	you	do	the	forensics	you’ll	find	clues
about	where	to	make	adjustments	and	how	to	eventually	accomplish	your	task."
Book 2,I’m	not	talking	about	a	mental	list	either.
Book 2,"After	the	second	attempt,	I	wrote
everything	out	long-hand,	but	didn’t	start	with	the	obvious	issue,	my	grip."
Book 2,"Initially,	I	brainstormed	everything	that	went	well,	because	in	every	failure	a	lot
of	good	things	will	have	happened,	and	we	must	acknowledge	them."
Book 2,The	best	takeaway	from	the	Nashville	attempt	was	Nandor’s	place.
Book 2,"His	dungeon
of	a	gym	was	the	perfect	environment	for	me."
Book 2,"Yeah,	I’m	on	social	media,	and	in
the	spotlight	from	time	to	time,	but	I	am	not	a	Hollywood	person."
Book 2,"I	get	my
strength	from	a	very	dark	place,	and	Nandor’s	gym	wasn’t	a	phony-ass,	happy
factory."
Book 2,"It	was	dark,	sweaty,	painful,	and	real."
Book 2,"I	called	him	the	very	next	day	and
asked	if	I	could	come	back	to	train	and	make	another	run	at	the	record."
Book 2,"I’d	taken
a	lot	of	his	time	and	energy	and	left	behind	a	mess,	so	I	had	no	idea	how	he’d
respond."
Book 2,"“Yeah,	motherfucker,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“Let’s	go!”	It	meant	a	lot	to	have	his	support
again."
Book 2,Another	positive	was	how	I	handled	my	second	meltdown.
Book 2,"I	was	off	the	mat	and
on	the	comeback	trail	before	I	even	saw	the	ER	doc."
Book 2,"That’s	where	you	want	to
be."
Book 2,"You	can’t	let	a	simple	failure	derail	your	mission,	or	let	it	worm	so	far	up
your	ass	it	takes	over	your	brain	and	sabotages	your	relationships	with	people
who	are	close	to	you."
Book 2,"Everyone	fails	sometimes	and	life	isn’t	supposed	to	be	fair,
much	less	bend	to	your	every	whim.Luck	is	a	capricious	bitch."
Book 2,"It	won’t	always	go	your	way,	so	you	can’t	get	trapped
in	this	idea	that	just	because	you’ve	imagined	a	possibility	for	yourself	that	you
somehow	deserve	it."
Book 2,Your	entitled	mind	is	dead	weight.
Book 2,Cut	it	loose.
Book 2,"Don’t	focus
on	what	you	think	you	deserve."
Book 2,"Take	aim	on	what	you	are	willing	to	earn!	I
never	blamed	anyone	for	my	failures,	and	I	didn’t	hang	my	head	in	Nashville."
Book 2,"I
stayed	humble	and	sidestepped	my	entitled	mind	because	I	knew	damn	well	I
hadn’t	earned	my	record."
Book 2,"The	scoreboard	does	not	lie,	and	I	didn’t	delude	myself
otherwise."
Book 2,"Believe	it	or	not,	most	people	prefer	delusion."
Book 2,"They	blame	others	or
bad	luck	or	chaotic	circumstance."
Book 2,"I	didn’t,	which	was	positive."
Book 2,"I	listed	most	of	the	equipment	we	used	on	the	positive	side	of	the	AAR,	as	well."
Book 2,"The	tape	and	chalk	worked,	and	even	though	the	bar	tore	me	the	fuck	up,	it	also
got	me	700	additional	pull-ups,	so	I	was	headed	in	the	right	direction."
Book 2,"Another
positive	was	the	support	of	Nandor’s	Crossfit	community."
Book 2,"It	felt	great	to	be
surrounded	by	such	intense,	respectful	people,	but	this	time	I’d	need	to	cut	the
number	of	volunteers	in	half."
Book 2,I	wanted	as	little	buzz	in	that	room	as	possible.
Book 2,"After	listing	out	all	the	plusses,	it	was	time	to	kick	the	tires	on	my	mindset,	and
if	you’re	doing	your	post-faceplant	due	diligence,	you	should	do	that	too."
Book 2,"That
means	checking	yourself	on	how	and	what	you	were	thinking	during	the
preparation	and	execution	phases	of	your	failure."
Book 2,"My	commitment	to	preparation
and	determination	in	the	fight	are	always	there."
Book 2,"They	didn’t	waver,	but	my	belief
was	shakier	than	I	cared	to	admit,	and	as	I	prepared	for	my	third	go	’round	it	was
imperative	to	move	beyond	doubt."
Book 2,"That	wasn’t	easy	because	after	my	second	failure	in	as	many	attempts,	the
doubters	were	everywhere	online."
Book 2,"The	record	holder,	Stephen	Hyland,	was	light
and	spidery	strong	with	thick,	muscular	palms."
Book 2,"He	was	the	perfect	build	for	the
pull-up	record,	and	everyone	was	telling	me	I	was	just	too	big,	my	form	was	too
brutal,	and	that	I	should	stop	trying	to	go	for	it	before	I	hurt	myself	even	worse."
Book 2,They	pointed	to	the	scoreboard	that	doesn’t	lie.
Book 2,"I	was	still	over	800	pull-ups
away	from	the	record."
Book 2,"That’s	more	than	I	gained	between	my	first	and	second
attempts."
Book 2,"From	the	beginning	some	of	them	had	predicted	my	hands	would	give
out,	and	when	that	truth	revealed	itself	in	Nashville	it	presented	a	big	mental
hurdle."
Book 2,Part	of	me	wondered	if	those	motherfuckers	were	right.
Book 2,"If	I	was	trying	to
achieve	the	impossible."
Book 2,Then	I	thought	of	an	English	middle-distance	runner	from	back	in	the	day	namedRoger	Bannister.
Book 2,"When	Bannister	was	trying	to	break	the	four-minute	mile	in	the
1950s,	experts	told	him	it	couldn’t	be	done,	but	that	didn’t	stop	him."
Book 2,"He	failed
again	and	again,	but	he	persevered,	and	when	he	ran	his	historic	mile	in	3:59.4
on	May	6,	1954,	he	didn’t	just	break	a	record,	he	broke	open	the	floodgates
simply	by	proving	it	possible."
Book 2,"Six	weeks	later,	his	record	was	eclipsed,	and	by
now	over	1,000	runners	have	done	what	was	once	thought	to	be	beyond	human
capability."
Book 2,"We	are	all	guilty	of	allowing	so-called	experts,	or	just	people	who	have	more
experience	in	a	given	field	than	we	do,	to	cap	our	potential."
Book 2,"One	of	the	reasons
we	love	sports	is	because	we	also	love	watching	those	glass	ceilings	get
shattered."
Book 2,"If	I	was	going	to	be	the	next	athlete	to	smash	popular	perception,	I’d
need	to	stop	listening	to	doubt,	whether	it	streamed	in	from	the	outside	or
bubbled	up	from	within,	and	the	best	way	to	do	that	was	to	decide	that	the	pull-
up	record	was	already	mine."
Book 2,"I	didn’t	know	when	it	would	officially	become
mine."
Book 2,"It	might	be	in	two	months	or	twenty	years,	but	once	I	decided	it	belonged
to	me	and	decoupled	it	from	the	calendar,	I	was	filled	with	confidence	and
relieved	of	any	and	all	pressure	because	my	task	morphed	from	trying	to	achieve
the	impossible	into	working	toward	an	inevitability."
Book 2,"But	to	get	there,	I’d	have	to
find	the	tactical	advantage	I’d	been	missing."
Book 2,A	tactical	review	is	the	final	and	most	vital	piece	of	any	live	autopsy	or	AAR.
Book 2,"And	while	I	had	improved	tactically	from	the	first	attempt—working	on	a	more
stable	bar	and	minimizing	wasted	energy—I	still	fell	800	reps	short,	so	we
needed	to	delve	deeper	into	the	numbers."
Book 2,"Six	pull-ups	per	minute	on	the	minute
had	failed	me	twice."
Book 2,"Yes,	it	placed	me	on	a	fast	track	to	4,020,	but	I	never	got
there."
Book 2,"This	time,	I	decided	to	start	slower	to	go	further."
Book 2,"I	also	knew	from
experience	that	I	would	hit	some	sort	of	wall	after	ten	hours	and	that	my
response	couldn’t	be	a	longer	break."
Book 2,"The	ten-hour	mark	smacked	me	in	my	face
twice	and	both	times	I	stopped	for	five	minutes	or	longer,	which	led	to	ultimate
failure	pretty	quickly."
Book 2,"I	needed	to	stay	true	to	my	strategy	and	limit	any	long
breaks	to	four	minutes	max."
Book 2,"Now,	about	that	pull-up	bar."
Book 2,"Yeah,	it	would	probably	tear	me	up	again,	so	I
needed	to	find	a	workaround."
Book 2,"According	to	the	rules,	I	wouldn’t	be	allowed	to
switch	up	the	distance	between	my	hands	mid-attempt."
Book 2,"The	width	would	have	to
remain	the	same	from	the	first	pull-up."
Book 2,"The	only	thing	I	could	change	would	be
how	I	was	going	to	protect	my	hands."
Book 2,"In	the	run-up	to	my	third	attempt,	Iexperimented	with	all	different	types	of	gloves."
Book 2,"I	also	got	clearance	to	use
custom	foam	pads	to	protect	my	palms."
Book 2,"I	remembered	seeing	a	couple	SEAL
buddies	use	slices	of	foam	mattresses	to	protect	their	hands	when	they	were
lifting	heavy	weights,	and	called	on	a	mattress	company	to	custom	design	form-
fitting	pads	for	my	hands."
Book 2,"Guinness	approved	the	equipment,	and	at	10	a.m.	on
January	19,	2013,	two	months	after	failing	for	the	second	time,	I	was	back	on	the
bar	at	Crossfit	Brentwood	Hills."
Book 2,I	started	slow	and	easy	with	five	pull-ups	on	the	minute.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	strap	my	foam
pads	with	tape."
Book 2,"I	just	held	them	in	place	around	the	bar,	and	they	seemed	to	work
well."
Book 2,"Within	an	hour	the	foam	had	formed	around	my	hands,	insulating	them
from	molten-iron	hell."
Book 2,Or	so	I	fucking	hoped.
Book 2,"At	around	the	two-hour,	600	rep
mark,	I	asked	Nandor	to	play	Going	the	Distance	on	a	loop."
Book 2,"I	felt	something
click	inside	and	went	full	cyborg."
Book 2,"I	found	a	rhythm	on	the	bar	and	between	sets	I	sat	on	a	weight	bench	and	stared
at	the	chalk-dusted	floor."
Book 2,"My	point	of	view	narrowed	into	tunnel	vision	as	I
prepared	my	mind	for	the	hell	that	was	to	come."
Book 2,"When	the	first	blister	opened	on
my	palm	I	knew	shit	was	about	to	get	real."
Book 2,"But	this	time,	thanks	to	my	failures
and	forensics,	I	was	ready."
Book 2,That	doesn’t	mean	I	was	having	any	fun.
Book 2,I	wasn’t.
Book 2,I	was	over	it.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	want	to
do	pull-ups	anymore,	but	achieving	goals	or	overcoming	obstacles	doesn’t	have
to	be	fun."
Book 2,Seeds	burst	from	the	inside	out	in	a	self-destructive	ritual	of	new	life.
Book 2,Does	that	sound	like	fucking	fun?
Book 2,Like	it	feels	good?
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	in	that	gym	to	get
happy	or	do	what	I	wanted	to	be	doing."
Book 2,"I	was	there	to	turn	myself	inside	out	if
that’s	what	it	took	to	blast	through	any	and	all	mental,	emotional,	and	physical
barriers."
Book 2,"After	twelve	hours,	I	finally	hit	3,000	pull-ups,	a	major	checkpoint	for	me,	and
felt	like	I’d	run	headfirst	into	a	wall."
Book 2,"I	was	exasperated,	in	agony,	and	my	hands
were	starting	to	come	apart	again."
Book 2,"I	was	still	a	long	way	from	the	record,	and	I
felt	all	the	eyeballs	in	the	room	upon	me."
Book 2,"With	them	came	the	crushing	weight	of
failure	and	humiliation."
Book 2,"Suddenly,	I	was	back	in	the	cage	during	my	third	Hell
Week,	taping	my	shins	and	ankles	before	mustering	up	with	a	new	BUD/S	class
who’d	heard	it	was	my	last	chance."
Book 2,"It	takes	great	strength	to	be	vulnerable	enough	to	put	your	ass	on	the	line,	inpublic,	and	work	toward	a	dream	that	feels	like	it’s	slipping	away."
Book 2,"We	all	have
eyeballs	on	us."
Book 2,"Our	family	and	friends	are	watching,	and	even	if	you’re
surrounded	by	positive	people,	they	will	have	ideas	about	who	you	are,	what
you’re	good	at,	and	how	you	should	focus	your	energy."
Book 2,"That	shit	is	just	human
nature,	and	if	you	try	to	break	out	of	their	box	you’ll	get	some	unsolicited	advice
that	has	a	way	of	smothering	your	aspirations	if	you	let	it."
Book 2,"Often	our	people	don’t
mean	any	harm."
Book 2,Nobody	who	cares	about	us	actually	wants	us	to	get	hurt.
Book 2,"They
want	us	to	be	safe,	comfortable,	and	happy,	and	not	to	have	to	stare	at	the	floor
in	a	dungeon	sifting	through	shards	of	our	broken	dreams."
Book 2,Too	bad.
Book 2,"There’s	a	lot
of	potential	in	those	moments	of	pain."
Book 2,"And	if	you	figure	out	how	to	piece	that
picture	back	together,	you’ll	find	a	hell	of	a	lot	of	power	there	too!
I	kept	my	break	to	just	four	minutes,	as	planned."
Book 2,"Long	enough	to	stuff	my	hands,
and	those	foam	pads,	into	a	pair	of	padded	gloves."
Book 2,"But	when	I	got	back	on	the
bar	I	felt	slow	and	weak."
Book 2,"Nandor,	his	wife,	and	the	other	volunteers	saw	my
struggle,	but	they	left	me	the	fuck	alone	to	put	in	my	ear	buds,	channel	Rocky
Balboa,	and	keep	grinding	one	rep	at	a	time."
Book 2,"I	went	from	four	pull-ups	on	the
minute	to	three,	and	found	my	cyborg	trance	again."
Book 2,"I	went	ugly,	I	got	dark."
Book 2,"I
imagined	my	pain	was	the	creation	of	a	mad	scientist	named	Stephen	Hyland,
the	evil	genius	who	was	in	temporary	possession	of	my	record	and	my	soul."
Book 2,"It
was	him!	That	motherfucker	was	torturing	me	from	across	the	globe,	and	it	was
up	to	me	and	only	me	to	keep	piling	up	numbers	and	steamroll	toward	him,	if	I
wanted	to	take	his	motherfucking	soul!
To	be	clear,	I	wasn’t	angry	with	Hyland—I	don’t	even	know	him!	I	went	there	to
find	the	edge	I	needed	to	keep	going."
Book 2,"I	got	personal	with	him	in	my	head,	not	out
of	overconfidence	or	envy,	but	to	drown	out	my	own	doubt."
Book 2,Life	is	a	head	game.
Book 2,This	was	just	the	latest	angle	I	used	to	win	a	game	within	that	game.
Book 2,"I	had	to	find
an	edge	somewhere,	and	if	you	find	it	in	the	person	standing	in	your	way,	that’s
potent."
Book 2,"As	the	hours	ticked	past	midnight	I	started	closing	the	distance	between	us,	but
the	pull-ups	weren’t	coming	fast	and	they	weren’t	coming	easy."
Book 2,"I	was	tired
mentally	and	physically,	deep	into	rhabdo,	and	I	was	down	to	three	pull-ups	a
minute."
Book 2,"When	I	hit	3,800	pull-ups	I	felt	like	I	could	see	the	mountain	top."
Book 2,"I	also
knew	it	was	possible	to	go	from	being	able	to	do	three	pull-ups	to	no	pull-ups	in
a	flash."
Book 2,"There	are	stories	of	people	at	Badwater	who	reached	mile	129	and
couldn’t	finish	a	135-mile	race!	You	never	know	when	you’ll	reach	your	100percent	and	hit	the	point	of	total	muscle	fatigue."
Book 2,"I	kept	waiting	for	that	moment
to	come,	when	I	couldn’t	pick	my	arms	up	anymore."
Book 2,"Doubt	stalked	me	like	a
shadow."
Book 2,"I	tried	my	best	to	control	it	or	silence	it,	yet	it	kept	reappearing,
following	me,	pushing	me."
Book 2,"After	seventeen	hours	of	pain,	around	3	a.m.	on	January	20,	2013,	I	did	my
4,020th	and	4,021st	pull-up,	and	the	record	was	mine."
Book 2,"Everyone	in	the	gym
cheered,	but	I	stayed	composed."
Book 2,"After	two	more	sets	and	4,030	total	pull-ups,	I
took	my	headphones	out,	stared	into	the	camera	and	said,	“I	tracked	you	down,
Stephen	Hyland!”
In	one	day,	I’d	lifted	the	equivalent	of	846,030	pounds,	nearly	three	times	the
weight	of	the	Space	Shuttle!	Cheers	spread	to	laughter	as	I	pulled	off	my	gloves
and	disappeared	into	the	back	room,	but	much	to	everyone’s	surprise,	I	was	not
in	the	mood	to	celebrate."
Book 2,Does	that	shock	you	too?
Book 2,"You	know	that	my	refrigerator	is	never	full,	and	it
never	will	be	because	I	live	a	mission-driven	life,	always	on	the	hunt	for	the	next
challenge."
Book 2,"That	mindset	is	the	reason	I	broke	that	record,	finished	Badwater,
became	a	SEAL,	rocked	Ranger	School,	and	on	down	the	list."
Book 2,"In	my	mind	I’m
that	racehorse	always	chasing	a	carrot	I’ll	never	catch,	forever	trying	to	prove
myself	to	myself."
Book 2,"And	when	you	live	that	way	and	attain	a	goal,	success	feels
anti-climactic."
Book 2,"Unlike	my	initial	shot	at	the	record,	my	success	barely	made	a	ripple	in	the	news
cycle."
Book 2,Which	was	just	fine.
Book 2,I	wasn’t	doing	it	for	adulation.
Book 2,"I	raised	some	money,
and	I	learned	all	I	could	from	that	pull-up	bar."
Book 2,"After	logging	more	than	67,000
pull-ups	in	nine	months,	it	was	time	to	put	them	in	my	Cookie	Jar	and	move	on."
Book 2,"Because	life	is	one	long	motherfucking	imaginary	game	that	has	no	scoreboard,
no	referee,	and	isn’t	over	until	we’re	dead	and	buried."
Book 2,And	all	I’d	ever	wanted	from	it	was	to	become	successful	in	my	own	eyes.
Book 2,"That
didn’t	mean	wealth	or	celebrity,	a	garage	full	of	hot	cars,	or	a	harem	of	beautiful
women	trailing	after	me."
Book 2,"It	meant	becoming	the	hardest	motherfucker	who	ever
lived."
Book 2,"Sure,	I	stacked	up	some	failures	along	the	way,	but	in	my	mind	the	record
proved	that	I	was	close."
Book 2,"Only	the	game	wasn’t	over,	and	being	hard	came	with
the	requirement	to	drain	every	drop	of	ability	from	my	mind,	body,	and	soul
before	the	whistle	blew.I	would	remain	in	constant	pursuit."
Book 2,I	wouldn’t	leave	anything	on	the	table.
Book 2,"I
wanted	to	earn	my	final	resting	place."
Book 2,"That’s	how	I	thought	back	then,	anyway."
Book 2,"Because	I	had	no	clue	how	close	to	the	end	I	already	was.CHALLENGE	#10
Think	about	your	most	recent	and	your	most	heart-wrenching	failures."
Book 2,"Break	out
that	journal	one	last	time."
Book 2,"Log	off	the	digital	version	and	write	them	out	long-
hand."
Book 2,"I	want	you	to	feel	this	process	because	you	are	about	to	file	your	own,
belated	After	Action	Reports."
Book 2,"First	off,	write	out	all	the	good	things,	everything	that	went	well,	from	your
failures."
Book 2,Be	detailed	and	generous	with	yourself.
Book 2,"A	lot	of	good	things	will	have
happened."
Book 2,It’s	rarely	all	bad.
Book 2,Then	note	how	you	handled	your	failure.
Book 2,"Did	it
affect	your	life	and	your	relationships?"
Book 2,How	so?
Book 2,"How	did	you	think	throughout	the	preparation	for	and	during	the	execution	stage
of	your	failure?"
Book 2,"You	have	to	know	how	you	were	thinking	at	each	step	because
it’s	all	about	mindset,	and	that’s	where	most	people	fall	short."
Book 2,Now	go	back	through	and	make	a	list	of	things	you	can	fix.
Book 2,"This	isn’t	time	to	be
soft	or	generous."
Book 2,"Be	brutally	honest,	write	them	all	out."
Book 2,Study	them.
Book 2,"Then	look	at
your	calendar	and	schedule	another	attempt	as	soon	as	possible."
Book 2,"If	the	failure
happened	in	childhood,	and	you	can’t	recreate	the	Little	League	all-star	game
you	choked	in,	I	still	want	you	to	write	that	report	because	you’ll	likely	be	able
to	use	that	information	to	achieve	any	goal	going	forward."
Book 2,"As	you	prepare,	keep	that	AAR	handy,	consult	your	Accountability	Mirror,	and
make	all	necessary	adjustments."
Book 2,"When	it	comes	time	to	execute,	keep	everything
we’ve	learned	about	the	power	of	a	calloused	mind,	the	Cookie	Jar,	and	The
40%	Rule	in	the	forefront	of	your	mind."
Book 2,Control	your	mindset.
Book 2,"Dominate	your
thought	process."
Book 2,This	life	is	all	a	fucking	mind	game.
Book 2,Realize	that.
Book 2,"Own	it!
And	if	you	fail	again,	so	the	fuck	be	it."
Book 2,Take	the	pain.
Book 2,"Repeat	these	steps	and
keep	fighting."
Book 2,That’s	what	it’s	all	about.
Book 2,"Share	your	stories	from	preparation,
training,	and	execution	on	social	media	with	the	hashtags	#canthurtme

11."
Book 2,WHAT	IF?
Book 2,Before	the	race	even	kicked	off	I	knew	I	was	fucked.
Book 2,"In	2014,	the	National	Park
Service	wouldn’t	approve	the	traditional	Badwater	course,	so	Chris	Kostman
redrew	the	map."
Book 2,"Instead	of	starting	in	Death	Valley	National	Park	and	running
forty-two	miles	through	the	hottest	desert	on	the	planet,	it	would	launch	further
upcountry	at	the	base	of	a	twenty-two-mile	climb."
Book 2,That	wasn’t	my	problem.
Book 2,"It
was	the	fact	that	I	toed	the	line	eleven	pounds	over	my	usual	race	weight,	and
had	gained	ten	of	those	pounds	in	the	previous	seven	days."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	a	fat	ass.
Book 2,"To
the	average	eye	I	looked	fit,	but	Badwater	wasn’t	an	average	race."
Book 2,"To	run	and
finish	strong,	my	condition	needed	to	be	tip	top,	and	I	was	far	from	it."
Book 2,"Whatever
was	happening	to	me	came	as	a	shock,	because	after	two	years	of	substandard
running,	I	thought	I’d	gotten	my	powers	back."
Book 2,"The	previous	January	I’d	won	a	one-hundred-kilometer	glacial	trail	race	called
Frozen	Otter."
Book 2,It	wasn’t	as	hard	as	the	Hurt	100	but	it	was	close.
Book 2,"Set	in
Wisconsin,	just	outside	Milwaukee,	the	course	laid	out	like	a	lopsided	figure
eight,	with	the	start-finish	at	the	center."
Book 2,"We	passed	it	between	the	two	loops,
which	enabled	us	to	stock	up	on	food	and	other	necessary	supplies	from	our	cars,
and	stuff	them	into	our	packs	with	our	emergency	supplies."
Book 2,"The	weather	can	turn
evil	out	there,	and	race	organizers	compiled	a	list	of	necessities	we	were	required
to	have	on	us	at	all	times	so	we	wouldn’t	die	of	dehydration,	hypothermia,	or
exposure."
Book 2,"The	first	lap	was	the	larger	loop	of	the	two	and	when	we	set	off	the	temperature
was	sitting	at	zero	degrees	Fahrenheit."
Book 2,Those	trails	were	never	plowed.
Book 2,"In	some
places,	snow	piled	into	drifts."
Book 2,"In	others	the	trails	seemed	purposefully	glazed
with	slick	ice."
Book 2,"Which	presented	a	problem	because	I	wasn’t	wearing	boots	or
trail	shoes	like	most	of	my	competitors."
Book 2,"I	laced	up	my	standard	running	shoes,
and	tucked	them	into	some	cheap	ass	crampons,	which	theoretically	were
supposed	to	grip	the	ice	and	keep	me	upright."
Book 2,"Well,	the	ice	won	that	war	and	my
crampons	snapped	off	in	the	first	hour."
Book 2,"Nevertheless,	I	was	leading	the	race	and
breaking	trail	in	an	average	of	six	to	twelve	inches	of	snow."
Book 2,In	some	places	thedrifts	were	piled	much	higher.
Book 2,"My	feet	were	cold	and	wet	from	the	starting	gun,
and	within	two	hours	they	felt	frozen	through,	especially	my	toes."
Book 2,"My	top	half
wasn’t	faring	much	better."
Book 2,"When	you	sweat	in	below-freezing	temperature,	salt
on	your	body	chafes	the	skin."
Book 2,"My	underarms	and	chest	were	cracking	raspberry
red."
Book 2,"I	was	covered	in	rashes,	my	toes	hurt	with	every	step,	but	none	of	that
registered	too	high	on	my	pain	scale,	because	I	was	running	free."
Book 2,"For	the	first	time	since	my	second	heart	surgery,	my	body	was	beginning	to	put
itself	back	together."
Book 2,"I	was	getting	100	percent	of	my	oxygen	supply	like
everyone	else,	my	endurance	and	strength	were	next-level,	and	though	the	trail
was	a	slippery	mess,	my	technique	was	dialed-in	too."
Book 2,"I	was	way	out	front	and
stopped	at	my	car	for	a	sandwich	before	the	last	twenty-two-mile	loop."
Book 2,"My	toes
throbbed	with	evil	pain."
Book 2,"I	suspected	they	were	frostbitten,	which	meant	I	was	in
danger	of	losing	some	of	them,	but	I	didn’t	want	to	take	off	my	shoes	and	look."
Book 2,"Once	again,	doubt	and	fear	were	popping	in	my	brain,	reminding	me	that	only	a
handful	of	people	had	ever	finished	the	Frozen	Otter,	and	that	no	lead	was	safe
in	that	kind	of	cold."
Book 2,"Weather,	more	than	any	other	variable,	can	break	a
motherfucker	down	quick."
Book 2,But	I	didn’t	listen	to	any	of	that.
Book 2,"I	created	a	new
dialogue	and	told	myself	to	finish	the	race	strong	and	worry	about	amputated
toes	at	the	hospital	after	I	was	crowned	champion."
Book 2,I	ran	back	onto	the	course.
Book 2,"A	blast	of	sun	had	melted	some	of	the	snow	earlier	in
the	day,	but	the	cold	wind	iced	up	the	trail	nicely."
Book 2,"As	I	ran,	I	flashed	to	my	first
year	at	Hurt	100	and	the	great	Karl	Meltzer."
Book 2,"Back	then,	I	was	a	plodder."
Book 2,"I	hit	the
turf	with	my	heel	first,	and	peeling	the	muddy	trail	with	the	entire	surface	area	of
my	foot	increased	my	odds	of	slipping	and	falling."
Book 2,Karl	didn’t	run	like	that.
Book 2,"He
moved	like	a	goat,	bouncing	on	his	toes	and	running	along	the	edges	of	the	trail."
Book 2,As	soon	as	his	toes	hit	the	ground	he	fired	his	legs	into	the	air.
Book 2,"That’s	why	he
looked	like	he	was	floating."
Book 2,"By	design,	he	barely	touched	the	ground,	while	his
head	and	core	remained	stable	and	engaged."
Book 2,"From	that	moment	onward,	his
movements	were	permanently	etched	in	my	brain	like	a	cave	painting."
Book 2,"I
visualized	them	all	the	time	and	put	his	techniques	into	practice	during	training
runs."
Book 2,They	say	it	takes	sixty-six	days	to	build	a	habit.
Book 2,"For	me	it	takes	a	hell	of	a	lot
longer	than	that,	but	I	eventually	get	there,	and	during	all	those	years	of	ultra
training	and	competition	I	was	working	on	my	craft."
Book 2,"A	true	runner	analyzes	their
form."
Book 2,"We	didn’t	learn	how	to	do	that	in	the	SEALs,	but	being	around	so	manyultra	runners	for	years,	I	was	able	to	absorb	and	practice	skills	that	seemed
unnatural	at	first."
Book 2,"At	Frozen	Otter,	my	main	focus	was	to	hit	the	ground	soft;	to
touch	it	just	enough	to	explode."
Book 2,"During	my	third	BUD/S	class	and	then	my	first
platoon,	when	I	was	considered	one	of	the	better	runners,	my	head	bounced	all
over	the	place."
Book 2,"My	weight	wasn’t	balanced	and	when	my	foot	hit	the	ground	all
my	weight	would	be	supported	by	that	one	leg,	which	led	to	some	awkward	falls
on	slippery	terrain."
Book 2,"Through	trial	and	error,	and	thousands	of	hours	of	training,	I
learned	to	maintain	balance."
Book 2,At	Frozen	Otter	it	all	came	together.
Book 2,"With	speed	and	grace,	I	navigated	steep,
slippery	trails."
Book 2,"I	kept	my	head	flat	and	still,	my	motion	quiet	as	possible,	and	my
steps	silent	by	running	on	the	front	of	my	feet."
Book 2,"When	I	picked	up	speed,	it	was	as
if	I’d	disappeared	into	a	white	wind,	elevated	into	a	meditative	state."
Book 2,"I	became
Karl	Meltzer."
Book 2,"Now	it	was	me	who	looked	to	be	levitating	over	an	impossible
trail,	and	I	finished	the	race	in	sixteen	hours,	smashing	the	course	record	and
winning	the	Frozen	Otter	title	without	losing	any	toes.Toes	after	Frozen	Otter
Two	years	earlier	I	was	stricken	with	dizzy	spells	during	easy	six-mile	runs."
Book 2,"In
2013,	I	was	forced	to	walk	over	one-hundred	miles	of	Badwater,	and	finished	inseventeenth	place."
Book 2,"I’d	been	on	a	downslide	and	thought	my	days	of	contention
for	titles	were	long	past	over."
Book 2,"After	Frozen	Otter,	I	was	tempted	to	believe	I’d
made	it	all	the	way	back	and	then	some,	and	that	my	best	ultra	years	were
actually	ahead	of	me."
Book 2,I	took	that	energy	into	my	preparations	for	Badwater	2014.
Book 2,"I	was	living	in	Chicago	at	the	time,	working	as	an	instructor	in	BUD/S	prep,	a
school	that	prepared	candidates	to	deal	with	the	harsh	reality	they	would	face	in
BUD/S."
Book 2,"After	more	than	twenty	years,	I	was	in	my	final	year	of	military	service,
and	by	being	placed	in	a	position	to	drop	wisdom	on	the	would-bes	and	wanna-
bes,	it	felt	like	I’d	come	full	circle."
Book 2,"As	usual	I	would	run	ten	miles	to	work	and
back,	and	squeeze	in	another	eight	miles	during	lunch	when	I	could."
Book 2,"On	the
weekends	I’d	do	at	least	one	thirty-five-	to	forty-mile	run."
Book 2,"It	all	added	up	to	a
succession	of	130-mile	weeks	and	I	was	feeling	strong."
Book 2,"As	spring	bloomed	I
added	a	heat	training	component	by	slipping	on	four	or	five	layers	of	sweats,	a
beanie,	and	a	Gore-Tex	jacket	before	hitting	the	streets."
Book 2,"When	I’d	show	up	at
work,	my	fellow	SEAL	instructors	would	watch,	amazed,	as	I	peeled	off	my	wet
clothes	and	stuffed	them	into	black	trash	bags	that	together	weighed	nearly
fifteen	pounds."
Book 2,"I	started	my	taper	four	weeks	out,	and	went	from	130-mile	weeks	to	an	eighty-
mile	week,	then	down	to	sixty,	forty,	and	twenty."
Book 2,"Tapering	is	supposed	to
generate	an	abundance	of	energy	as	you	eat	and	rest,	enabling	the	body	to	repair
all	the	damage	done	and	get	you	primed	for	competition."
Book 2,"Instead,	I’d	never	felt
worse."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	hungry	and	couldn’t	sleep	at	all.
Book 2,"Some	people	said	my	body	was
starved	of	calories."
Book 2,Others	suggested	I	might	be	low	on	sodium.
Book 2,"My	doctor
measured	my	thyroid	and	it	was	a	little	off,	but	the	readings	weren’t	so	bad	to
explain	how	shitty	I	felt."
Book 2,Perhaps	the	explanation	was	simple.
Book 2,"That	I	was	over-
trained."
Book 2,Two	weeks	before	the	race	I	considered	pulling	out.
Book 2,"I	worried	it	was	my	heart
again	because	on	easy	runs	I	felt	a	surge	of	adrenaline	that	I	couldn’t	vent."
Book 2,"Even
a	mellow	pace	sent	my	pulse	racing	into	arrhythmia."
Book 2,"Ten	days	before	the	race,	I
landed	in	Vegas."
Book 2,"I’d	scheduled	five	runs	but	couldn’t	get	past	the	three-mile
mark	on	any	of	them."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	eating	that	much	but	the	weight	kept	piling	on.
Book 2,"It
was	all	water."
Book 2,"I	sought	out	another	doctor	who	confirmed	there	was	nothing
physically	wrong	with	me	and	when	I	heard	that,	I	was	not	about	to	be	a	pussy."
Book 2,"During	the	opening	miles	and	initial	climb	of	Badwater	2014,	my	heart	rate	ranhigh,	but	part	of	that	was	the	altitude,	and	twenty-two	miles	later	I	made	it	to	the
top	in	sixth	or	seventh	place."
Book 2,"Surprised	and	proud,	I	thought,	let’s	see	if	I	can	go
downhill."
Book 2,"I’ve	never	enjoyed	the	brutality	of	running	down	a	steep	incline
because	it	shreds	the	quads,	but	I	also	thought	it	would	allow	me	to	reset	and
calm	my	breath."
Book 2,My	body	refused.
Book 2,I	couldn’t	catch	my	breath	at	all.
Book 2,"I	hit	the	flat
section	at	the	bottom,	slowed	my	pace,	and	began	to	walk."
Book 2,"My	competitors
passed	me	by	as	my	thighs	twitched	uncontrollably."
Book 2,"My	muscle	spasms	were	so
bad,	my	quads	looked	like	there	was	an	alien	rattling	around	inside	them."
Book 2,"And	I	still	didn’t	stop!	I	walked	for	four	full	miles	before	seeking	shelter	in	a
Lone	Pine	motel	room	where	the	Badwater	medical	team	had	set	up	shop."
Book 2,"They
checked	me	out	and	saw	that	my	blood	pressure	was	a	bit	low	but	easily
corrected."
Book 2,"They	couldn’t	find	a	single	metric	that	could	explain	how	fucked	I
felt."
Book 2,"I	ate	some	solid	food,	rested	and	decided	to	try	one	more	time."
Book 2,"There	was	a	flat
section	leaving	Lone	Pine	and	I	thought	if	I	could	knock	that	out	perhaps	I’d
catch	a	second	wind,	but	six	or	seven	miles	later	my	sails	were	still	empty,	and
I’d	given	all	I	had."
Book 2,"My	muscles	trembled	and	twitched,	my	heart	jumped	up	and
down	the	chart."
Book 2,"I	looked	over	at	my	pacer	and	said,	“That’s	it,	man."
Book 2,"I’m	done.”
My	support	vehicle	pulled	up	behind	us	and	I	climbed	inside."
Book 2,"A	few	minutes
later	I	was	laying	on	that	same	motel	bed,	with	my	tail	between	my	legs."
Book 2,"I’d
lasted	just	fifty	miles,	but	any	humiliation	that	came	with	quitting—not
something	I	was	used	to—was	drowned	out	by	an	instinct	that	something	was
way	the	fuck	off."
Book 2,It	wasn’t	my	fear	talking	or	my	desire	for	comfort.
Book 2,"This	time,	I
was	certain	that	if	I	didn’t	stop	trying	to	break	through	this	barrier,	I	wouldn’t
make	it	out	of	the	Sierras	alive."
Book 2,"We	left	Lone	Pine	for	Las	Vegas	the	next	night,	and	for	two	days	I	did	my	best
to	rest	and	recover,	hoping	my	body	would	settle	somewhere	close	to
equilibrium."
Book 2,"We	were	staying	at	the	Wynn,	and	on	that	third	morning	I	went	for
a	jog	to	see	if	I	had	anything	in	the	tank."
Book 2,"One	mile	later,	my	heart	was	in	my
throat,	and	I	shut	it	down."
Book 2,"I	walked	back	to	the	hotel,	knowing	that	despite	what
the	doctors	said,	I	was	sick	and	suspected	that	whatever	I	had	was	serious."
Book 2,"Later	that	night,	after	seeing	a	movie	in	the	Vegas	suburbs,	I	felt	weak	as	we
strolled	to	a	nearby	restaurant,	the	Elephant	Bar."
Book 2,My	mom	was	a	few	pacesahead	and	I	saw	her	in	triplicate.
Book 2,"I	clenched	my	eyes	shut,	released	them,	and
there	were	still	three	of	her."
Book 2,"She	held	the	door	open	for	me	and	when	I	stepped
into	the	cool	confines,	I	felt	a	bit	better."
Book 2,"We	slid	into	a	booth	opposite	one
another."
Book 2,I	was	too	unsteady	to	read	the	menu	and	asked	her	to	order	for	me.
Book 2,"From	there,	it	got	worse,	and	when	the	runner	showed	up	with	our	food,	my
vision	blurred	again."
Book 2,"I	strained	to	open	my	eyes	wide	and	felt	woozy	as	my
mother	looked	to	be	floating	above	the	table."
Book 2,"“You’re	going	to	have	to	call	an	ambulance,”	I	said,	“because	I’m	going	down.”
Desperate	for	some	stability,	I	laid	my	head	on	the	table,	but	my	mom	didn’t	dial
911."
Book 2,"She	crossed	to	my	side	and	I	leaned	on	her	as	we	made	our	way	to	the
hostess	stand	and	then	back	to	the	car."
Book 2,"On	the	way	I	shared	as	much	of	my
medical	history	as	I	could	recall,	in	short	bursts,	in	case	I	lost	consciousness	and
she	did	have	to	call	for	help."
Book 2,"Luckily,	my	vision	and	energy	improved	enough
for	her	to	drive	me	to	the	emergency	room	herself."
Book 2,"My	thyroid	had	been	flagged	in	the	past,	so	that’s	the	first	thing	the	doctors
explored."
Book 2,"Many	Navy	SEALs	have	thyroid	issues	when	they	reach	their	thirties,
because	when	you	put	motherfuckers	in	extreme	environments	like	Hell	Week
and	war,	their	hormone	levels	go	haywire."
Book 2,"When	the	thyroid	gland	is	suboptimal,
fatigue,	muscle	aches,	and	weakness	are	among	more	than	a	dozen	major	side
effects,	but	my	thyroid	levels	were	close	to	normal."
Book 2,My	heart	checked	out	too.
Book 2,The	ER	docs	in	Vegas	told	me	all	I	needed	was	rest.
Book 2,"I	went	back	to	Chicago	and	saw	my	own	doctor	who	ordered	a	battery	of	blood
tests."
Book 2,"His	office	tested	my	endocrine	system	and	screened	me	for	Lyme,
hepatitis,	Rheumatoid	arthritis,	and	a	handful	of	other	autoimmune	diseases."
Book 2,"Everything	came	back	clean	except	for	my	thyroid	which	was	slightly
suboptimal,	but	that	didn’t	explain	how	I’d	morphed	so	fast	from	an	elite	athlete
capable	of	running	hundreds	of	miles	into	a	pretender	who	could	barely	muster
the	energy	to	tie	his	shoes,	let	alone	run	a	mile	without	verging	on	collapse."
Book 2,"I
was	in	medical	no-man’s-land."
Book 2,"I	left	his	office	with	more	questions	than	answers
and	a	prescription	for	thyroid	medication."
Book 2,Each	day	that	went	by	I	felt	worse.
Book 2,Everything	was	crashing	on	me.
Book 2,"I	had	trouble
getting	out	of	bed,	I	was	constipated	and	achy."
Book 2,"They	took	more	blood	and
decided	I	had	Addison’s	disease,	an	autoimmune	illness	that	occurs	when	youradrenals	are	drained	and	your	body	doesn’t	produce	enough	cortisol,	which	was
common	in	SEALs	because	we’re	primed	to	run	on	adrenaline."
Book 2,"My	doctor
prescribed	the	steroid	Hydrocortisone,	DHEA,	and	Arimidex	among	other	meds,
but	taking	his	pills	only	accelerated	my	decline,	and	after	that,	he	and	the	other
doctors	I	saw	were	tapped	out."
Book 2,The	look	in	their	eyes	said	it	all.
Book 2,"In	their	minds,	I
was	either	a	crazy	hypochondriac,	or	I	was	dying	and	they	didn’t	know	what	was
killing	me	or	how	to	heal	me."
Book 2,I	fought	through	it	the	best	I	could.
Book 2,"My	coworkers	didn’t	know	anything	about
my	decline	because	I	continued	to	show	no	weakness."
Book 2,"My	whole	life	I’d	been
hiding	all	my	insecurities	and	trauma."
Book 2,"I	kept	all	my	vulnerabilities	locked	down
beneath	an	iron	veneer,	but	eventually	the	pain	became	so	bad	I	couldn’t	even
get	out	of	bed."
Book 2,"I	called	in	sick	and	lay	there,	staring	at	the	ceiling,	and	wondered,
could	this	be	the	end?"
Book 2,"Peering	into	the	abyss	sent	my	mind	reeling	back	through	the	days,	weeks,	years,
like	fingers	flipping	through	old	files."
Book 2,"I	found	all	the	best	parts	and	tacked	them
together	into	a	highlight	loop	streamed	on	repeat."
Book 2,"I	grew	up	beat	down	and
abused,	filtered	uneducated	through	a	system	that	rejected	me	at	every	turn,	until
I	took	ownership	and	started	to	change."
Book 2,Since	then	I’d	been	obese.
Book 2,"I	was	married
and	divorced."
Book 2,"I	had	two	heart	surgeries,	taught	myself	to	swim,	and	learned	to
run	on	broken	legs."
Book 2,"I	was	terrified	of	heights,	then	took	up	high	altitude	sky
diving."
Book 2,"Water	scared	the	living	shit	out	of	me,	yet	I	became	a	technical	diver	and
underwater	navigator,	which	is	several	degrees	of	difficulty	beyond	scuba
diving."
Book 2,"I	competed	in	more	than	sixty	ultra	distance	races,	winning	several,	and
set	a	pull-up	record."
Book 2,"I	stuttered	through	my	early	years	in	primary	school	and
grew	up	to	become	the	Navy	SEALs’	most	trusted	public	speaker."
Book 2,"I’d	served	my
country	on	the	battlefield."
Book 2,"Along	the	way	I	became	driven	to	make	sure	that	I
could	not	be	defined	by	the	abuse	I	was	born	into	or	the	bullying	that	I	grew	up
with."
Book 2,"I	wouldn’t	be	defined	by	talent	either,	I	didn’t	have	much,	or	my	own	fears
and	weaknesses."
Book 2,I	was	the	sum	total	of	the	obstacles	I’d	overcome.
Book 2,"And	even	though	I’d	told	my
story	to	students	all	over	the	country,	I	never	stopped	long	enough	to	appreciate
the	tale	I	told	or	the	life	I’d	built."
Book 2,"In	my	mind,	I	didn’t	have	the	time	to	waste."
Book 2,"I
never	hit	snooze	on	my	life	clock	because	there	was	always	something	else	to
do."
Book 2,"If	I	worked	a	twenty-hour	day,	I’d	work	out	for	an	hour	and	sleep	for	three,
but	I	made	sure	to	get	that	motherfucker	in."
Book 2,"My	brain	wasn’t	wired	to	appreciate,it	was	programmed	to	do	work,	scan	the	horizon,	ask	what’s	next,	and	get	it
done."
Book 2,That’s	why	I	piled	up	so	many	rare	feats.
Book 2,"I	was	always	on	the	hunt	for	the
next	big	thing,	but	as	I	lay	there	in	bed,	my	body	taut	with	tension	and	throbbing
with	pain,	I	had	a	clear	idea	what	was	next	for	me."
Book 2,The	cemetery.
Book 2,"After	years	of
abuse,	I’d	finally	shredded	my	physical	body	beyond	repair."
Book 2,I	was	dying.
Book 2,"For	weeks	and	months,	I	searched	for	a	cure	to	my	medical	mystery,	but	in	that
moment	of	catharsis	I	didn’t	feel	sad	and	I	didn’t	feel	cheated."
Book 2,"I	was	only	thirty-
eight	years	old,	but	I’d	lived	ten	lives	and	experienced	a	hell	of	a	lot	more	than
most	eighty-year-olds."
Book 2,I	wasn’t	feeling	sorry	for	myself.
Book 2,"It	made	sense	that	at
some	point	the	toll	would	come	due."
Book 2,"I	spent	hours	reflecting	back	on	my
journey."
Book 2,"This	time,	I	wasn’t	sifting	through	the	Cookie	Jar	while	in	the	heat	of
battle	hoping	to	find	a	ticket	to	victory."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	leveraging	my	life	assets	toward
some	new	end."
Book 2,"No,	I	was	done	fighting,	and	all	I	felt	was	gratitude."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	meant	to	be	this	person!	I	had	to	fight	myself	at	every	turn,	and	my
destroyed	body	was	my	biggest	trophy."
Book 2,"In	that	moment	I	knew	it	didn’t	matter	if
I	ever	ran	again,	if	I	couldn’t	operate	anymore,	or	if	I	lived	or	died,	and	with	that
acceptance	came	deep	appreciation."
Book 2,My	eyes	welled	with	tears.
Book 2,"Not	because	I	was	afraid,	but	because	at	my	lowest
point	I	found	clarity."
Book 2,"The	kid	I	always	judged	so	harshly	didn’t	lie	and	cheat	to
hurt	anyone’s	feelings."
Book 2,He	did	it	for	acceptance.
Book 2,"He	broke	the	rules	because	he
didn’t	have	the	tools	to	compete	and	was	ashamed	for	being	dumb."
Book 2,"He	did	it
because	he	needed	friends."
Book 2,I	was	afraid	to	tell	the	teachers	I	couldn’t	read.
Book 2,"I	was
terrified	of	the	stigma	associated	with	special	education,	and	instead	of	coming
down	on	that	kid	for	one	more	second,	instead	of	chastising	my	younger	self,	I
understood	him	for	the	first	time."
Book 2,It	was	a	lonely	journey	from	there	to	here.
Book 2,I	missed	out	on	so	much.
Book 2,"I	didn’t	have
a	lot	of	fun."
Book 2,Happiness	wasn’t	my	cocktail	of	choice.
Book 2,"My	brain	had	me	on
constant	blast."
Book 2,"I	lived	in	fear	and	doubt,	terrified	of	being	a	nobody	and
contributing	nothing."
Book 2,"I’d	judged	myself	constantly	and	I’d	judged	everyone	else
around	me,	too."
Book 2,Rage	is	a	powerful	thing.
Book 2,"For	years	I’d	raged	at	the	world,	channeled	all	my	painfrom	my	past	and	used	it	as	fuel	to	propel	me	into	the	motherfucking
stratosphere,	but	I	couldn’t	always	control	the	blast	radius."
Book 2,"Sometimes	my	rage
scorched	people	who	weren’t	as	strong	as	I’d	become,	or	didn’t	work	as	hard,
and	I	didn’t	swallow	my	tongue	or	hide	my	judgment."
Book 2,"I	let	them	know,	and	that
hurt	some	of	the	people	around	me,	and	it	allowed	people	who	didn’t	like	me	to
affect	my	military	career."
Book 2,"But	lying	in	bed	on	that	Chicago	morning	in	the	fall	of
2014,	I	let	all	that	judgment	go."
Book 2,I	released	myself	and	everyone	I	ever	knew	from	any	and	all	guilt	and	bitterness.
Book 2,"The	long	list	of	haters,	doubters,	racists,	and	abusers	that	populated	my	past,	I
just	couldn’t	hate	them	anymore."
Book 2,"I	appreciated	them	because	they	helped	create
me."
Book 2,"And	as	that	feeling	stretched	out,	my	mind	quieted	down."
Book 2,"I’d	been	fighting	a
war	for	thirty-eight	years,	and	now,	at	what	looked	and	felt	like	the	very	end,	I
found	peace."
Book 2,"In	this	life	there	are	countless	trails	to	self-realization,	though	most	demand
intense	discipline,	so	very	few	take	them."
Book 2,"In	southern	Africa,	the	San	people
dance	for	thirty	hours	straight	as	a	way	to	commune	with	the	divine."
Book 2,"In	Tibet,
pilgrims	rise,	kneel,	then	stretch	out	face	down	on	the	ground	before	rising
again,	in	a	ritual	of	prostration	for	weeks	and	months,	as	they	cover	thousands	of
miles	before	arriving	at	a	sacred	temple	and	folding	into	deep	meditation."
Book 2,"In
Japan	there’s	a	sect	of	Zen	monks	that	run	1,000	marathons	in	1,000	days	in	a
quest	to	find	enlightenment	through	pain	and	suffering."
Book 2,"I	don’t	know	if	you
could	call	what	I	felt	on	that	bed	“enlightenment,”	but	I	do	know	that	pain
unlocks	a	secret	doorway	in	the	mind."
Book 2,"One	that	leads	to	both	peak	performance
and	beautiful	silence."
Book 2,"At	first,	when	you	push	beyond	your	perceived	capability	your	mind	won’t	shut
the	fuck	up	about	it."
Book 2,"It	wants	you	to	stop	so	it	sends	you	into	a	spin	cycle	of
panic	and	doubt,	which	only	amplifies	your	self-torture."
Book 2,"But	when	you	persist
past	that	to	the	point	that	pain	fully	saturates	the	mind,	you	become	single-
pointed."
Book 2,The	external	world	zeroes	out.
Book 2,"Boundaries	dissolve	and	you	feel
connected	to	yourself,	and	to	all	things,	in	the	depth	of	your	soul."
Book 2,"That’s	what	I
was	after."
Book 2,"Those	moments	of	total	connection	and	power,	which	came	through
me	again	in	an	even	deeper	way	as	I	reflected	on	where	I’d	come	from	and	all
I’d	put	myself	through."
Book 2,"For	hours,	I	floated	in	that	tranquil	space,	surrounded	by	light,	feeling	as	muchgratitude	as	pain,	as	much	appreciation	as	there	was	discomfort."
Book 2,"At	some	point
the	reverie	broke	like	a	fever."
Book 2,"I	smiled,	placed	my	palms	over	my	watery	eyes
and	rubbed	the	top	and	then	the	back	of	my	head."
Book 2,"At	the	base	of	my	neck,	I	felt	a
familiar	knot."
Book 2,It	bulged	bigger	than	ever.
Book 2,"I	threw	off	the	covers	and	examined	the
knots	above	my	hip	flexors	next."
Book 2,Those	had	grown	too.
Book 2,Could	it	be	that	basic?
Book 2,Could	my	suffering	be	linked	to	those	knots?
Book 2,"I	flashed
back	to	a	session	with	an	expert	in	stretching	and	advanced	physical	and	mental
training	methods	the	SEALs	brought	to	our	base	in	Coronado	in	2010	named	Joe
Hippensteel."
Book 2,"Joe	was	an	undersized	decathlete	in	college,	driven	to	make	the
Olympic	team."
Book 2,"But	when	you’re	a	5’8”	guy	going	up	against	world-class
decathletes	who	average	6’3”	that	isn’t	easy."
Book 2,"He	decided	to	build	up	his	lower
body	so	he	could	override	his	genetics	to	jump	higher	and	run	faster	than	his
bigger,	stronger	opponents."
Book 2,"At	one	point	he	was	squatting	twice	his	own	body
weight	for	ten	sets	of	ten	reps	in	one	session,	but	with	that	increase	in	muscle
mass	came	a	lot	of	tension,	and	tension	invited	injury."
Book 2,"The	harder	he	trained,	the
more	injuries	he	developed	and	the	more	physical	therapists	he	visited."
Book 2,"When	he
was	told	he	tore	his	hamstring	before	the	trials,	his	Olympic	dream	died,	and	he
realized	he	needed	to	change	the	way	he	trained	his	body."
Book 2,"He	began	balancing
his	strength	work	with	extensive	stretching	and	noticed	whenever	he	reached	a
certain	range	of	motion	in	a	given	muscle	group	or	joint,	whatever	pain	lingered,
vanished."
Book 2,"He	became	his	own	guinea	pig	and	developed	optimal	ranges	of	motion	for
every	muscle	and	joint	in	the	human	body."
Book 2,"He	never	went	to	the	doctor	or
physical	therapists	again	because	he	found	his	own	methodologies	much	more
effective."
Book 2,"If	an	injury	cropped	up,	he	treated	himself	with	a	stretching	regimen."
Book 2,"Over	the	years	he	built	up	a	clientele	and	reputation	among	elite	athletes	in	the
area,	and	in	2010,	was	introduced	to	some	Navy	SEALs.	Word	spread	at	Naval
Special	Warfare	Command	and	he	was	eventually	invited	to	introduce	his	range
of	motion	routine	to	about	two	dozen	SEALs.	I	was	one	of	them."
Book 2,"As	he	lectured,	he	examined	and	stretched	us	out."
Book 2,"The	problem	with	most	of	the
guys,	he	said,	was	our	overuse	of	muscles	without	the	appropriate	balance	of
flexibility,	and	those	issues	traced	back	to	Hell	Week,	when	we	were	asked	to	do
thousands	of	flutter	kicks,	then	lie	back	in	cold	water	with	waves	washing	over
us."
Book 2,"He	estimated	it	would	take	twenty	hours	of	intensive	stretching	using	his
protocol	to	get	most	of	us	back	to	a	normal	range	of	motion	in	the	hips,	whichcan	then	be	maintained,	he	said,	with	just	twenty	minutes	of	stretching	every
day."
Book 2,Optimal	range	of	motion	required	a	larger	commitment.
Book 2,"When	he	got	to	me
he	took	a	good	look	and	shook	his	head."
Book 2,"As	you	know,	I’d	tasted	three	Hell
Weeks."
Book 2,"He	started	to	stretch	me	out,	and	said	I	was	so	locked	up	it	was	like
trying	to	stretch	steel	cables."
Book 2,"“You’re	gonna	need	hundreds	of	hours,”	he	said."
Book 2,"At	the	time,	I	didn’t	pay	him	any	mind	because	I	had	no	plans	to	take	up
stretching."
Book 2,"I	was	obsessed	with	strength	and	power,	and	everything	I’d	read
suggested	that	an	increase	in	flexibility	meant	an	equal	and	opposite	decrease	in
speed	and	force."
Book 2,The	view	from	my	death	bed	altered	my	perspective.
Book 2,"I	pulled	myself	up,	staggered	to	the	bathroom	mirror,	turned,	and	examined	the
knot	on	my	head."
Book 2,I	stood	as	tall	as	I	could.
Book 2,"It	looked	like	I’d	lost	not	one,	but
nearly	two	inches	in	height."
Book 2,My	range	of	motion	had	never	been	worse.
Book 2,"What	if
Joe	was	right?"
Book 2,What	if?
Book 2,One	of	my	mottos	these	days	is	peaceful	but	never	satisfied.
Book 2,"It	was	one	thing	to
enjoy	the	peace	of	self-acceptance,	and	my	acceptance	of	the	fucked-up	world	as
it	is,	but	that	didn’t	mean	I	was	going	to	lie	down	and	wait	to	die	without	at	least
trying	to	save	myself."
Book 2,"It	didn’t	mean	then,	and	it	doesn’t	mean	now,	that	I	will
accept	the	imperfect	or	just	plain	wrong	without	fighting	to	change	things	for	the
better."
Book 2,"I’d	tried	accessing	the	mainstream	mind	to	find	healing,	but	the	doctors
and	their	drugs	didn’t	do	shit	except	make	me	feel	a	whole	lot	worse."
Book 2,"I	had	no
other	cards	to	play."
Book 2,All	I	could	do	is	try	to	stretch	myself	back	to	health.
Book 2,The	first	posture	was	simple.
Book 2,"I	sat	on	the	ground	and	tried	to	cross	my	legs,
Indian	style,	but	my	hips	were	so	tight,	my	knees	were	up	around	my	ears."
Book 2,"I	lost
my	balance	and	rolled	onto	my	back."
Book 2,"It	took	all	my	strength	to	right	myself	and
try	again."
Book 2,"I	stayed	in	position	for	ten	seconds,	maybe	fifteen,	before
straightening	my	legs	because	it	was	too	damn	painful."
Book 2,Cramps	squeezed	and	pinched	every	muscle	in	my	lower	body.
Book 2,"Sweat	oozed
from	my	pores,	but	after	a	short	rest,	I	folded	up	my	legs	and	took	more	pain."
Book 2,"I
cycled	through	that	same	stretch	on	and	off	for	an	hour	and	slowly,	my	bodystarted	to	open."
Book 2,I	did	a	simple	quad	stretch	next.
Book 2,"The	one	we	all	learn	to	do	in
middle	school."
Book 2,"Standing	on	my	left	leg,	I	bent	my	right	and	grabbed	my	foot
with	my	right	hand."
Book 2,Joe	was	right.
Book 2,"My	quads	were	so	bulky	and	tight	it	was	like
stretching	steel	cables."
Book 2,"Again,	I	stayed	in	the	posture	until	the	pain	was	a	seven
out	of	ten."
Book 2,Then	I	took	a	short	break	and	hit	the	other	side.
Book 2,That	standing	posture	helped	to	release	my	quad	and	stretch	out	my	psoas.
Book 2,"The
psoas	is	the	only	muscle	connecting	our	spine	to	our	lower	legs."
Book 2,"It	wraps	around
the	back	of	the	pelvis,	governs	the	hips,	and	is	known	as	the	fight	or	flight
muscle."
Book 2,"As	you	know,	my	whole	life	was	fight	or	flight."
Book 2,"As	a	young	kid
drowning	in	toxic	stress,	I	worked	that	muscle	overtime."
Book 2,"Ditto	during	my	three
Hell	Weeks,	Ranger	School,	and	Delta	Selection."
Book 2,Not	to	mention	war.
Book 2,"Yet	I
never	did	anything	to	loosen	it	up,	and	as	an	athlete	I	continued	to	tap	my
sympathetic	nervous	system	and	had	been	grinding	so	hard	my	psoas	continued
to	stiffen."
Book 2,"Especially	on	long	runs,	where	sleep	deprivation	and	cold	weather
came	into	play."
Book 2,"Now,	it	was	trying	to	choke	me	from	the	inside	out."
Book 2,"I’d	learn
later	that	it	had	tilted	my	pelvis,	compressed	my	spine,	and	wrapped	my
connective	tissue	tight."
Book 2,It	shaved	two	inches	off	my	height.
Book 2,"I	spoke	to	Joe	about
it	recently."
Book 2,"“What	was	happening	to	you	is	an	extreme	case	of	what	happens	to	90	percent
of	the	population,”	he	said."
Book 2,"“Your	muscles	were	so	locked	up	that	your	blood
wasn’t	circulating	very	well."
Book 2,They	were	like	a	frozen	steak.
Book 2,"You	can’t	inject
blood	into	a	frozen	steak,	and	that’s	why	you	were	shutting	down.”
And	it	wouldn’t	let	go	without	a	fight."
Book 2,Each	stretch	plunged	me	into	the	fire.
Book 2,"I
had	so	much	inflammation	and	internal	stiffness,	the	slightest	movement	hurt,
say	nothing	of	long	hold	poses	meant	to	isolate	my	quad	and	psoas."
Book 2,"When	I	sat
down	and	did	the	butterfly	stretch	next,	the	torture	intensified."
Book 2,"I	stretched	for	two	hours	that	day,	woke	up	sore	as	hell,	and	got	back	after	it."
Book 2,"On
day	two	I	stretched	for	six	full	hours."
Book 2,"I	did	the	same	three	poses	over	and	over,
then	tried	to	sit	on	my	heels,	in	a	double	quad	stretch	that	was	pure	agony."
Book 2,"I
worked	a	calf	stretch	in	too."
Book 2,"Each	session	started	off	rough,	but	after	an	hour	or
two	my	body	released	enough	for	the	pain	to	ease	up."
Book 2,Before	long	I	was	folded	into	stretches	for	upwards	of	twelve	hours	a	day.
Book 2,"I
woke	up	at	6	a.m.,	stretched	until	9	a.m.,	and	then	stretched	on	and	off	while	atthe	desk	at	work,	especially	when	I	was	on	the	phone."
Book 2,"I’d	stretch	out	during	my
lunch	hour	and	then	after	I	got	home	at	5	p.m.,	I’d	stretch	until	I	hit	the	sack."
Book 2,"I	came	up	with	a	routine,	starting	at	my	neck	and	shoulders	before	moving	into
the	hips,	psoas,	glutes,	quads,	hamstrings,	and	calves."
Book 2,"Stretching	became	my
new	obsession."
Book 2,I	bought	a	massage	ball	to	tenderize	my	psoas.
Book 2,"I	propped	a	board
up	against	a	closed	door	at	a	seventy-degree	angle	and	used	it	to	stretch	out	my
calf."
Book 2,"I’d	been	suffering	for	the	better	part	of	two	years,	and	after	several	months
of	continual	stretching,	I	noticed	the	bump	at	the	base	of	my	skull	had	started	to
shrink,	along	with	the	knots	around	my	hip	flexors,	and	my	overall	health	and
energy	level	improved."
Book 2,"I	wasn’t	anywhere	close	to	flexible	yet,	and	I	wasn’t
completely	back	to	myself,	but	I	was	off	all	but	my	thyroid	medication,	and	the
more	I	stretched	the	more	my	condition	improved."
Book 2,"I	kept	at	it	for	at	least	six
hours	a	day	for	weeks."
Book 2,Then	months	and	years.
Book 2,I’m	still	doing	it.
Book 2,"***
I	retired	from	the	military	as	a	Chief	in	the	Navy,	in	November	2015,	the	only
military	man	ever	to	be	part	of	Air	Force	TAC-P,	three	Navy	SEAL	Hell	Weeks
in	one	year	(completing	two	of	them),	and	graduate	BUD/S	and	Army	Ranger
School."
Book 2,"It	was	a	bittersweet	moment	because	the	military	was	a	big	part	of	my
identity."
Book 2,"It	helped	shape	me	and	make	me	a	better	man,	and	I	gave	it	everything	I
had."
Book 2,By	then	Bill	Brown	had	moved	on	too.
Book 2,"He	grew	up	marginalized	like	me,	wasn’t
supposed	to	amount	to	much,	and	even	got	bounced	from	his	first	BUD/S	class
by	instructors	who	questioned	his	intelligence."
Book 2,"Today,	he	is	a	lawyer	at	a	major
firm	in	Philadelphia."
Book 2,Freak	Brown	proved	and	continues	to	prove	himself.
Book 2,Sledge	is	still	in	the	SEAL	Teams.
Book 2,"When	I	met	him	he	was	a	big	time	boozer,
but	after	our	workouts	his	mentality	changed."
Book 2,"He	went	from	never	running	at	all
to	running	marathons."
Book 2,"From	not	owning	a	bicycle	to	becoming	one	of	the	fastest
cyclists	in	San	Diego."
Book 2,He’s	finished	multiple	Ironman	triathlons.
Book 2,"They	say	iron
sharpens	iron,	and	we	proved	that."
Book 2,"Shawn	Dobbs	never	became	a	SEAL,	but	he	did	become	an	Officer."
Book 2,"He’s	a
Lieutenant	Commander	these	days,	and	he’s	still	a	hell	of	an	athlete."
Book 2,"He’s	an
Ironman,	an	accomplished	cyclist,	was	honor	man	in	the	Navy’s	Advanced	DiveSchool,	and	later	earned	a	graduate	degree."
Book 2,"One	reason	for	all	of	his	success	is
because	he’s	come	to	own	his	failure	in	Hell	Week,	which	means	it	no	longer
owns	him."
Book 2,"SBG	is	still	in	the	Navy	too,	but	he’s	not	messing	with	BUD/S	candidates
anymore."
Book 2,"He	analyzes	data	to	make	sure	Naval	Special	Warfare	continues	to
become	smarter,	stronger,	and	more	effective	than	ever."
Book 2,He’s	an	egghead	now.
Book 2,An	egghead	with	an	edge.
Book 2,"But	I	was	with	him	when	he	was	at	his	physical	peak,
and	he	was	a	fucking	stud."
Book 2,"Since	our	dark	days	in	Buffalo	and	Brazil,	my	mother	has	also	completely
transformed	her	life."
Book 2,"She	earned	a	master’s	degree	in	education	and	serves	as	a
volunteer	on	a	domestic	violence	task	force,	when	she’s	not	working	as	a	senior
associate	vice	president	at	a	Nashville	medical	school."
Book 2,"As	for	me,	stretching	helped	me	get	my	powers	back."
Book 2,"As	my	time	in	the	military
wound	down,	while	I	was	still	in	the	rehab	zone,	I	studied	to	recertify	as	an
EMT."
Book 2,"Once	again,	I	utilized	my	long-hand	memorization	skills	I’d	been	honing
since	high	school	to	finish	at	the	top	of	my	class."
Book 2,"I	also	attended	TEEX	Fire
Training	Academy,	where	I	graduated	Top	Honor	Man	in	my	class."
Book 2,"Eventually,	I
started	running	again,	this	time	with	zero	side	effects,	and	when	I	got	back	into
decent	enough	shape,	I	entered	a	few	ultras	and	returned	to	the	top	spot	in
several	including	the	Strolling	Jim	40-Miler	in	Tennessee,	and	Infinitus	88k	in
Vermont,	both	in	2016."
Book 2,"But	that	wasn’t	enough,	so	I	became	a	wildland
firefighter	in	Montana."
Book 2,"After	wrapping	up	my	first	season	on	the	fire	lines	in	the	summer	of	2015,	I
stopped	by	my	mother’s	place	in	Nashville	for	a	visit."
Book 2,"At	midnight	her	phone
rang."
Book 2,"My	mother	is	like	me	in	the	sense	that	she	doesn’t	have	a	wide	circle	of
friends	and	doesn’t	get	many	phone	calls	during	decent	hours,	so	this	was	either
a	wrong	number	or	an	emergency."
Book 2,I	could	hear	Trunnis	Jr.	on	the	other	end	of	the	line.
Book 2,"I	hadn’t	seen	or	spoken	to
him	in	over	fifteen	years."
Book 2,"Our	relationship	broke	down	the	moment	he	chose	to
stay	with	our	father	rather	than	tough	it	out	with	us."
Book 2,"For	most	of	my	life	I	found
his	decision	impossible	to	forgive	or	accept,	but	like	I	said,	I’d	changed."
Book 2,"Through	the	years,	my	mother	kept	me	updated	on	the	basics."
Book 2,"He’d	eventually
stepped	away	from	our	father	and	his	shady	businesses,	earned	a	PhD,	andbecame	a	college	administrator."
Book 2,He	is	also	a	great	father	to	his	kids.
Book 2,I	could	tell	by	my	mom’s	voice	that	something	was	wrong.
Book 2,"All	I	remember
hearing	was	my	mom	asking,	“Are	you	sure	it’s	Kayla?”	When	she	hung	up,	she
explained	that	Kayla,	his	eighteen-year-old	daughter,	had	been	hanging	with
friends	in	Indianapolis."
Book 2,"At	some	point	looser	acquaintances	rolled	up,	bad	blood
boiled,	a	gun	was	pulled,	shots	rang	out,	and	a	stray	bullet	found	one	of	the
teenagers."
Book 2,"When	his	ex-wife	called	him,	in	panic	mode,	he	drove	to	the	crime	scene,	but
when	he	arrived	he	was	held	outside	the	yellow	tape	and	kept	in	the	dark."
Book 2,"He
could	see	Kayla’s	car	and	a	body	under	a	tarp,	but	nobody	would	tell	him	if	his
daughter	was	alive	or	dead."
Book 2,My	mother	and	I	hit	the	road	immediately.
Book 2,"I	drove	eighty	mph	through	slanted
rain	for	five	hours	straight	to	Indianapolis."
Book 2,"We	pulled	into	his	driveway	shortly
after	he	returned	from	the	crime	scene	where,	while	standing	outside	the	yellow
tape,	he	was	asked	to	identify	his	daughter	from	a	picture	of	her	body	taken	on	a
detective’s	cell	phone."
Book 2,"He	wasn’t	offered	the	dignity	of	privacy	or	time	to	pay
respects."
Book 2,He	had	to	do	all	that	later.
Book 2,"He	opened	the	door,	took	a	few	steps	toward
us,	and	broke	down	crying."
Book 2,My	mother	got	there	first.
Book 2,"Then	I	pulled	my	brother
in	for	a	hug	and	all	of	our	bullshit	issues	no	longer	mattered."
Book 2,"***
The	Buddha	famously	said	that	life	is	suffering."
Book 2,"I’m	not	a	Buddhist,	but	I	know
what	he	meant	and	so	do	you."
Book 2,"To	exist	in	this	world,	we	must	contend	with
humiliation,	broken	dreams,	sadness,	and	loss."
Book 2,That’s	just	nature.
Book 2,"Each	specific
life	comes	with	its	own	personalized	portion	of	pain."
Book 2,It’s	coming	for	you.
Book 2,"You
can’t	stop	it."
Book 2,And	you	know	it.
Book 2,"In	response,	most	of	us	are	programmed	to	seek	comfort	as	a	way	to	numb	it	all
out	and	cushion	the	blows."
Book 2,We	carve	out	safe	spaces.
Book 2,"We	consume	media	that
confirms	our	beliefs,	we	take	up	hobbies	aligned	with	our	talents,	we	try	to
spend	as	little	time	as	possible	doing	the	tasks	we	fucking	loathe,	and	that	makes
us	soft."
Book 2,"We	live	a	life	defined	by	the	limits	we	imagine	and	desire	for	ourselves
because	it’s	comfortable	as	hell	in	that	box."
Book 2,"Not	just	for	us,	but	for	our	closest
family	and	friends."
Book 2,The	limits	we	create	and	accept	become	the	lens	throughwhich	they	see	us.
Book 2,Through	which	they	love	and	appreciate	us.
Book 2,"But	for	some,	those	limits	start	to	feel	like	bondage,	and	when	we	least	expect	it,
our	imagination	jumps	those	walls	and	hunts	down	dreams	that	in	the	immediate
aftermath	feel	attainable."
Book 2,Because	most	dreams	are.
Book 2,"We	are	inspired	to	make
changes	little	by	little,	and	it	hurts."
Book 2,"Breaking	the	shackles	and	stretching	beyond
our	own	perceived	limits	takes	hard	fucking	work—oftentimes	physical	work—
and	when	you	put	yourself	on	the	line,	self	doubt	and	pain	will	greet	you	with	a
stinging	combination	that	will	buckle	your	knees."
Book 2,"Most	people	who	are	merely	inspired	or	motivated	will	quit	at	that	point,	and
upon	their	return,	their	cells	will	feel	that	much	smaller,	their	shackles	even
tighter."
Book 2,"The	few	who	remain	outside	their	walls	will	encounter	even	more	pain
and	much	more	doubt,	courtesy	of	those	who	we	thought	were	our	biggest	fans."
Book 2,"When	it	was	time	for	me	to	lose	106	pounds	in	less	than	three	months,	everyone
I	talked	to	told	me	there	was	no	way	I	could	do	it."
Book 2,"“Don’t	expect	too	much,”	they
all	said."
Book 2,Their	weak-ass	dialogue	only	fed	my	own	self	doubt.
Book 2,But	it’s	not	the	external	voice	that	will	break	you	down.
Book 2,"It’s	what	you	tell
yourself	that	matters."
Book 2,"The	most	important	conversations	you’ll	ever	have	are	the
ones	you’ll	have	with	yourself."
Book 2,"You	wake	up	with	them,	you	walk	around	with
them,	you	go	to	bed	with	them,	and	eventually	you	act	on	them."
Book 2,"Whether	they	be
good	or	bad."
Book 2,"We	are	all	our	own	worst	haters	and	doubters	because	self	doubt	is	a	natural
reaction	to	any	bold	attempt	to	change	your	life	for	the	better."
Book 2,"You	can’t	stop	it
from	blooming	in	your	brain,	but	you	can	neutralize	it,	and	all	the	other	external
chatter	by	asking,	What	if?"
Book 2,"What	if	is	an	exquisite	fuck-you	to	anyone	who	has	ever	doubted	your	greatness
or	stood	in	your	way."
Book 2,It	silences	negativity.
Book 2,"It’s	a	reminder	that	you	don’t	really
know	what	you’re	capable	of	until	you	put	everything	you’ve	got	on	the	line."
Book 2,"It
makes	the	impossible	feel	at	least	a	little	more	possible."
Book 2,"What	if	is	the	power	and
permission	to	face	down	your	darkest	demons,	your	very	worst	memories,	and
accept	them	as	part	of	your	history."
Book 2,"If	and	when	you	do	that,	you	will	be	able	to
use	them	as	fuel	to	envision	the	most	audacious,	outrageous	achievement	and	go
get	it.We	live	in	a	world	with	a	lot	of	insecure,	jealous	people."
Book 2,"Some	of	them	are	our
best	friends."
Book 2,They	are	blood	relatives.
Book 2,Failure	terrifies	them.
Book 2,So	does	our	success.
Book 2,"Because	when	we	transcend	what	we	once	thought	possible,	push	our	limits,	and
become	more,	our	light	reflects	off	all	the	walls	they’ve	built	up	around	them."
Book 2,"Your	light	enables	them	to	see	the	contours	of	their	own	prison,	their	own	self-
limitations."
Book 2,"But	if	they	are	truly	the	great	people	you	always	believed	them	to	be,
their	jealousy	will	evolve,	and	soon	their	imagination	might	hop	its	fence,	and	it
will	be	their	turn	to	change	for	the	better."
Book 2,I	hope	that’s	what	this	book	has	done	for	you.
Book 2,"I	hope	that	right	now	you	are
nose-to-concrete	with	your	own	bullshit	limits	you	didn’t	even	know	were	there."
Book 2,I	hope	you’re	willing	to	do	the	work	to	break	them	down.
Book 2,"I	hope	you’re	willing
to	change."
Book 2,"You’ll	feel	pain,	but	if	you	accept	it,	endure	it,	and	callous	your	mind,
you’ll	reach	a	point	where	not	even	pain	can	hurt	you."
Book 2,"There	is	a	catch,	however."
Book 2,"When	you	live	this	way,	there	is	no	end	to	it."
Book 2,"Thanks	to	all	that	stretching,	I’m	in	better	shape	at	forty-three	than	I	was	in	my
twenties."
Book 2,"Back	then	I	was	always	sick,	wound	tight,	and	stressed	out."
Book 2,"I	never
analyzed	why	I	kept	getting	stress	fractures."
Book 2,I	just	taped	that	shit	up.
Book 2,"No	matter
what	ailed	my	body	or	my	mind	I	had	the	same	solution."
Book 2,"Tape	it	up	and	move
the	fuck	on."
Book 2,Now	I’m	smarter	than	I’ve	ever	been.
Book 2,And	I’m	still	getting	after	it.
Book 2,In	2018	I	went	back	to	the	mountains	to	become	a	wildland	firefighter	again.
Book 2,"I
hadn’t	been	in	the	field	for	three	years,	and	since	then	I’d	gotten	used	to	training
in	nice	gyms	and	living	in	comfort."
Book 2,Some	might	call	it	luxury.
Book 2,"I	was	in	a	plush
hotel	room	in	Vegas	when	the	416	fire	sparked	and	I	got	the	call."
Book 2,"What	started	as
a	2,000-acre	grass	fire	in	the	San	Juan	Range	of	Colorado’s	Rocky	Mountains
was	growing	into	a	record	breaking,	55,000-acre	monster."
Book 2,"I	hung	up	and	caught
a	prop	plane	to	Grand	Junction,	loaded	up	in	a	U.S.	Forest	Service	truck,	and
drove	three	hours	to	the	outskirts	of	Durango,	Colorado,	where	I	suited	up	in	my
green	Nomex	pants	and	yellow,	long-sleeved	button	down,	my	hard	hat,	field
glasses,	and	gloves,	and	grabbed	my	super	Pulaski—a	wildland	fire	fighter’s
most	trusted	weapon."
Book 2,"I	can	dig	for	hours	with	that	thing,	and	that’s	what	we	do."
Book 2,We	don’t	spray	water.
Book 2,"We	specialize	in	containment,	and	that	means	digging
lines	and	clearing	brush	so	there’s	no	fuel	in	the	path	of	an	inferno."
Book 2,"We	dig	and
run,	run	and	dig,	until	every	muscle	is	spent."
Book 2,Then	we	do	it	all	over	again.
Book 2,On	our	first	day	and	night	we	dug	fire	lines	around	vulnerable	homes	as	walls	offlames	marched	forward	from	less	than	a	mile	away.
Book 2,"We	glimpsed	the	burn
through	the	trees	and	felt	the	heat	in	the	drought-stricken	forest."
Book 2,"From	there	we
were	deployed	to	10,000	feet	and	worked	on	a	forty-five-degree	slope,	digging
as	deep	as	possible,	trying	to	get	to	the	mineral	soil	that	won’t	burn."
Book 2,"At	one	point
a	tree	fell	and	missed	hitting	one	of	my	teammates	by	eight	inches."
